<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The obstacles which the layman finds to understanding Einstein&#x2019;s relativity theories
lie not so much in the inherent difficulty of these theories themselves as in the
difficulty of preparing the mind for their reception. The theory is no more difficult
than any scientific development of comparable depth; it is not so difficult as some
of these. But it is a fact that for a decent understanding of it, a large background
of scientific knowledge and scientific habit of thought is essential. The bulk of
the writers who have attempted to explain Einstein to the general reader have not
realized the great gulf which lies between the mental processes of the trained mathematician
and those of the man in the street. They have not perceived that the lay reader must
be personally conducted for a long distance from the vestibule of the temple of science
before he comes to Einstein, and that he cannot by any possibility make this journey
unaided. The result has been to pitchfork the reader into the intricacies of the subject
without adequate preparation.
</p>
<p>The present volume avoids this mistake with the utmost care. It avoids it, in fact,
with such deliberation as to make it in order to say a word in explanation of what
will at first glance seem an extraordinary arrangement of material. It was to be expected,
doubtless, that this book would open with a brief statement of the genesis and the
outcome of <span class="pagenum" id="xd29e415">[<a href="#xd29e415">iv</a>]</span>the Einstein Prize Essay Contest for the $5,000 prize offered by Mr. Eugene Higgins.
It was doubtless to be expected that, after this had been dismissed, the winning essay
would be given the post of honor in advance of all other material bearing actually
on the Einstein theories. When the reader observes that this has not been done, he
will by all means expect a word of explanation; and it is mainly for the purpose of
giving this that we make these introductory remarks.
</p>
<p>The essays submitted in the contest, and in particular the comments of a few disappointed
readers upon Mr. Bolton&#x2019;s prize essay, make quite plain what might have been anticipated&#x2014;that
in the small compass of 3,000 words it is not possible both to prepare the reader&#x2019;s
mind for a discussion of Relativity and to give a discussion that shall be adequate.
Mr. Bolton himself, in replying to a protest that he had not done all this, has used
the word &#x201c;miracle&#x201d;&#x2014;we think it a well-advised one. No miracle was expected as a result
of the contest, and none has been achieved. But in awarding the prize, the Judges
had to decide whether it was the best preliminary exposition or the best discussion
that was wanted. They decided, and rightly we believe, that the award should go to
an actual statement of what the Einstein theories are and what they do, rather than
to a mere introduction, however well conceived and well executed the latter might
be. Nevertheless, we should be closing our eyes to a very obvious fact if we did not
recognize that, without something in the way of preparation, the general reader is
not going to pursue Mr. Bolton&#x2019;s <span class="pagenum" id="xd29e419">[<a href="#xd29e419">v</a>]</span>essay, or any other essay on this subject, with profit. It is in order the more forcefully
to hold out inducements to him to subject himself to this preparation that we place
at the head of the book the chapters designed to give it to him.
</p>
<p>Chapter II. is intended so to bring the mind of the reader into contact with certain
philosophical problems presented to us by our experiences with the external world
and our efforts to learn the facts about it, that he may approach the subject of relativity
with an appreciation of the place it occupies as a phase of human thought and a pillar
of the scientific structure. Until the reader is aware of the existence of these problems
and the directions taken by the efforts, successful and unsuccessful, to unravel them,
he is not equipped to comprehend the doctrine of relativity at all; he is in much
the same case as a child whose education had reached only the primer stage, if asked
to read the masterpieces of literature. He lacks not alone the vocabulary, but equally
the mental background on which the vocabulary is based.
</p>
<p>It will be noted that in this and the chapters immediately following it, the Editor
has supplied material freely. The obvious interpretation is that satisfactory material
covering the desired ground was not found in any of the essays; for we are sure the
scope and number of the credited excerpts will make it clear that all contributions
were adequately scrutinized in search of available passages. This &#x201c;inadequacy&#x201d; of
the competing essays has been severely commented upon by several correspondents, and
the inference drawn that as a whole the offerings <span class="pagenum" id="xd29e424">[<a href="#xd29e424">vi</a>]</span>were not up to the mark. Such a viewpoint is wholly unjust to the contestants. The
essays which paid serious attention to the business of paving the way to relativity
necessarily did so at the expense of completeness in the later paragraphs where specific
explanation of the Einstein theories was in order. Mr. Law, whose essay was by all
means the best of those that gave much space to introductory remarks, found himself
left with only 600 words in which to tell what it was that he had been introducing.
The majority of the contestants appear to have faced the same question as to subject
matter which the Judges faced, and to have reached the same decision. They accordingly
devoted their attention toward the prize, rather than toward the production of an
essay that would best supplement that of the winner. It is for this very reason that,
in these preliminary chapters, so large a proportion of the material has had to be
supplied by the Editor; and this very circumstance is a tribute to the good judgment
of the competitors, rather than ground for criticism of their work.
</p>
<p>The general introduction of Chapter II. out of the way, Chapters III. and IV. take
up the business of leading the reader into the actual subject of relativity. The subject
is here developed in what may be called the historical order&#x2014;the order in which it
took form in Einstein&#x2019;s own mind. Both in and outside the contest of which this book
is the outcome, a majority of those who have written on relativity have followed this
order, which is indeed a very natural one and one well calculated to give to the rather
surprising assumptions of relativity <span class="pagenum" id="xd29e428">[<a href="#xd29e428">vii</a>]</span>a reasonableness which they might well appear to the lay mind to lack if laid down
more arbitrarily. In these two chapters no effort <span class="corr" id="xd29e430" title="Source: is made is made">is made</span> to carry the argument beyond the formulation of the Special Principle of the relativity
of uniform motion, but this principle is developed in considerably more detail than
would be the case if it were left entirely to the competing essayists. The reason
for this is again that we are dealing with a phase of the subject which is of subordinate
importance so far as a complete statement of the General Theory of Relativity is concerned,
but which is of the greatest significance in connection with the effort of the layman
to acquire the proper preliminary orientation toward the larger subject.
</p>
<p>Chapter V. goes back again to general ground. Among the ideas which the competing
essayists were forced to introduce into their text on a liberal scale is that of non-Euclidean
geometry. The entire formulation of the General Theory of Relativity is in fact an
exercise in this. The essayists&#x2014;good, bad and indifferent alike&#x2014;were quite unanimous
in their decision that this was one thing which the reader would have to assume the
responsibility of acquiring for himself. Certainly they were justified in this; for
the Editor has been able to explain what non-Euclidean geometry is only by using up
considerably more space than the contestants had for an entire essay. No effort has
been made to set forth any of the details of any of the various non-Euclidean geometries;
it has simply been the aim to draw the dividing line between Euclidean and non-Euclidean,
and to make the existence of the latter appear <span class="pagenum" id="xd29e435">[<a href="#xd29e435">viii</a>]</span>reasonable, so that when the essayists come to talk about it the reader will not feel
hopelessly at sea. In other words, this is another case of providing the mental background,
but on such a scale that it has seemed necessary to give a separate chapter to it.
</p>
<p>Chapter VI. completes the preliminary course in the fundamentals of relativity by
tying up together the findings of Chapter V. and those of Chapters III. and IV. It
represents more or less of a last-minute change of plan; for while it had been the
Editor&#x2019;s intent from the beginning to place the material of Chapters II.&#x2013;V. in its
present position, his preliminary impression would have been that the work of the
present Chapter VI. would be adequately done by the essayists themselves. His reading
of the essays, however, convinced him that it had not so been done&#x2014;that with the possible
exception of Mr. Francis, the essayists did not make either a serious or a successful
effort to show the organic connection <span class="corr" id="xd29e439" title="Source: btween">between</span> the Special Theory of Relativity and the Minkowski space-time structure, or the utter
futility of trying to reconcile ourselves to the results of the former without employing
the ideas of the latter. So Chapter VI. was supplied to make good this deficiency,
and to complete the mental equipment which the reader requires for his battle with
the General Theory.
</p>
<p>In laying down a set of general principles to govern the award of the prize, one of
the first things considered by the Judges was the relative importance of the Special
and the General Theories. It was their opinion that no essay could possibly qualify
for the prize which did not very distinctly <span class="pagenum" id="xd29e444">[<a href="#xd29e444">ix</a>]</span>give to the General Theory the center of the stage; and that in fact discussion of
the Special Theory was pertinent only so long as it contributed, in proportion to
the space assigned it, to the attack upon the main subject. The same principle has
been employed in selecting essays for complete or substantially complete reproduction
in this volume. Writers who dealt with the Special Theory in any other sense than
as a preliminary step toward the General Theory have been relegated to the introductory
chapters, where such excerpts from their work have been used as were found usable.
The distinction of publication under name and title is reserved for those who wrote
consistently and specifically upon the larger subject&#x2014;with the one exception of Dr.
Russell, whose exposition of the Special Theory is so far the best of those submitted
and at the same time so distinctive that we have concluded it will appear to better
advantage by itself than as a part of Chapters III. and IV.
</p>
<p>Following after Mr. Bolton&#x2019;s essay we have tried to arrange the various contributions,
not at all in any order of merit, but in the order that will make connected reading
of the book most nearly possible and profitable. Each essay should be made easier
of reading by the examination of those preceding it; at the same time each, by the
choice of ground covered and by the emphasis on points not brought out sharply by
its predecessors, should throw new light upon these predecessors.
</p>
<p>The reader will find that no two of the essays given thus in full duplicate or even
come close to duplicating one another. They have of course been <span class="pagenum" id="xd29e450">[<a href="#xd29e450">x</a>]</span>selected with this in view; each represents the best of several essays of substantially
the same character. Not all of them require comment here, but concerning some of them
a word may well be said.
</p>
<p>Mr. Francis, we believe, has succeeded in packing more substance into his 3,000 words
than any other competitor. Mr. Elliot has come closer than anybody else to really
explaining relativity in terms familiar to everybody, without asking the reader to
enlarge his vocabulary and with a minimum demand so far as enlarging his mental outlook
is concerned. Were it not for certain conspicuous defects, his essay would probably
have taken the prize. In justice to the Judges, we should state that we have taken
the liberty of eliminating Mr. Elliot&#x2019;s concluding paragraph, which was the most objectionable
feature of his essay.
</p>
<p>Dr. Dushman chose for his title the one which we adopted for this book. It became
necessary, therefore, for us to find a new title for his essay; aside from this instance,
the main titles appearing at the heads of the various complete essays are those of
the authors. The subtitles have in practically every instance been supplied editorially.
</p>
<p>Dr. Pickering submitted two essays, one written from the viewpoint of the physicist,
the other from that of the astronomer. To make each complete, he naturally found it
necessary to duplicate between them certain introductory and general material. We
have run the two essays together into a single narrative, with the elimination of
this duplicated material; aside from this blue-penciling no alteration has been made
in Dr. Pickering&#x2019;s text. This text however <span class="pagenum" id="xd29e456">[<a href="#xd29e456">xi</a>]</span>served as the basis of blue-penciling that of several other contestants, as indicated
in the foot notes.
</p>
<p>For the reader who is qualified or who can qualify to understand it, Dr. Murnaghan&#x2019;s
essay is perhaps the most illuminating of all. Even the reader who does not understand
it all will realize that its author brings to the subject a freshness of viewpoint
and an originality of treatment which are rather lacking in some of the published
essays, and which it will readily be understood were conspicuously lacking in a good
many of the unpublished ones. Dr. Murnaghan of all the competitors has come closest
to making a contribution to science as well as to the semi-popular literature of science.
</p>
<p>In the composite chapters, the brackets followed by reference numbers have been used
as the most practicable means of identifying the various individual contributions.
We believe that this part of the text can be read without allowing the frequent occurrence
of these symbols to distract the eye. As to the references themselves, the asterisk
marks the contributions of the Editor. The numbers are those attached to the essays
in order of and at the time of their receipt; it has been more convenient to use these
than to assign consecutive numbers to the quoted essays. The several numbers identify
passages from the essays of the following contestants:

undertaken generally to improve upon the language of the competitors, but merely that
the reading of all their essays has given him many ideas of such complex origin that

<p class="first"><span class="sc">How the Contest Came to be Held, and Some of the Details of its Conduct</span></p>
</div>
<p class="byline">BY THE EDITOR</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In January, 1909, an anonymous donor who was interested in the spread of correct scientific
ideas offered through the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span> a prize of $500 for the best essay explaining, in simple non-technical language,
that paradise of mathematicians and bugaboo of plain ordinary folk&#x2014;the fourth dimension.
Many essays were submitted in this competition, and in addition to that of the winner
some twenty were adjudged worthy of ultimate publication. It was felt that the competition
had added distinctly to the popular understanding of this significant subject; that
it had done much to clear up popular misconception of just what the mathematician
means when he talks of four or even more dimensions; and that it had therefore been
as successful as it was unusual in character.
</p>
<p>In November, 1919, the world was startled by the announcement from London that examination
of the photographs taken during the total solar eclipse of May 29th had been concluded,
and that predictions based upon the Einstein theories of relativity had been verified.
In the reaction from the long surfeit of war news an item of this sort was a thoroughly
journalistic one. Long cable dispatches <span class="pagenum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>were carried in the news columns all over the world; Einstein and his theories were
given a prominent place on the front pages day after day; leading scientists in great
number were called upon to tell the public through the reportorial medium just what
the excitement was all about, just in what way the classical scientific structure
had been overthrown.
</p>
<p>Instead of being a mere nine days&#x2019; wonder, the Einstein theories held their place
in the public mind. The more serious periodicals devoted space to them. First and
last, a very notable group of scientific men attempted to explain to the general reader
the scope and content of Einstein&#x2019;s system. These efforts, well considered as they
were, could be no more than partially successful on account of the very radical character
of the revisions which the relativity doctrine demands in our fundamental concepts.
Such revisions cannot be made in a day; the average person has not the viewpoint of
the mathematician which permits a sudden and complete exchange of one set of fundamentals
for another. But the whole subject had caught the popular attention so strongly, that
even complete initial failure to discover what it was all about did not discourage
the general reader from pursuing the matter with determination to come to some understanding
of what had happened to Newton and Newtonian mechanics.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Donor and the Prize</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In May, 1920, Mr. Eugene Higgins, an American citizen long resident in Paris, a liberal
patron of the arts and sciences, and a lifelong friend of the <span class="sc">Scientific <span class="pagenum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>American</span> and its proprietors, suggested that the success of the Fourth Dimension Prize Contest
of 1910 had been so great that it might be desirable to offer another prize in similar
fashion for the best popular essay on the Einstein theories. He stated that if in
the opinion of the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span> these theories were of sufficient importance, and the probability of getting a good
number of meritorious essays were sufficiently great, and the public need and desire
for enlightenment were sufficiently present, he would feel inclined to offer such
a prize, leaving the conduct of the contest to the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span> as in the former event. It was the judgment of the editors of the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span> that all these provisos should be met with an affirmative, and that Mr. Higgins accordingly
could with propriety be encouraged to offer the prize.
</p>
<p>In his preliminary letter Mr. Higgins had suggested that in view of the apparent greater
importance of the subject to be proposed for discussion by the contestants of 1920,
the prize offered should probably be more liberal than in the former instance. This
view met with the approval of the editors as well; but they were totally unprepared
for the receipt, late in June, of a cablegram from Mr. Higgins stating that he had
decided to go ahead with the matter, and that he was forwarding a draft for $5,000
to represent the amount of the prize. Such a sum, exceeding any award open to a professional
man with the single exception of the Nobel Prize, for which he cannot specifically
compete, fairly took the breath of the Editors, and made it immediately <span class="pagenum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>clear that the contest would attract the widest attention, and that it should score
the most conspicuous success. It also made it clear that the handling of the contest
would be a more serious matter than had been anticipated.
</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that it would not for some time be possible to announce the identity
of the Judges, it was felt that the prospective contestants should have every opportunity
for extensive preparation; so the contest was announced, and the rules governing it
printed as far as they could be determined on such short shrift, in the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span> for July 10, 1920. Several points of ambiguity had to be cleared up after this initial
publication. In particular, it had been Mr. Higgins&#x2019; suggestion that in the very probable
event of the Judges&#x2019; inability to agree upon the winning essay, the prize might, at
their discretion, be divided between the contributors of the best two essays. This
condition was actually printed in the first announcement, but the Post Office Department
insisted upon its withdrawal, on the ground that with it in force the contestant would
not know whether he were competing for $5,000 or for $2,500, and that this would introduce
the &#x201c;element of chance&#x201d; which alone was necessary, under the Federal statutes, to
make the contest a lottery. So this provision was replaced by one to the effect that
in the event the Judges were not able to agree, the Einstein Editor should cast the
deciding vote between the essays respectively favored by them.
</p>
<p>The announcement attracted the widest attention, and was copied in newspapers and
magazines all over the world. Inquiries poured in from all quarters, <span class="pagenum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>and the Einstein Editor found it almost impossible to keep himself supplied with proofs
of the conditions and rules to mail in response to these inquiries. It was immediately
clear that there was going to be a large number of essays submitted, and that many
distinguished names would be listed among the competitors.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Judges</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span> for September 18, announcement was carried in the following words:
</p>
<p>&#x201c;We are assured with complete certainty that the competition for the five-thousand-dollar
prize will be very keen, and that many essays will be submitted which, if they bore
the names of their authors, would pass anywhere as authoritative statements. The judges
will confront a task of extraordinary difficulty in the effort to determine which
of these efforts is the best; and we believe the difficulties are such that multiplication
of judges would merely multiply the obstacles to an agreement. It is altogether likely
that the initial impressions of two or three or five judges would incline toward two
or three or five essays, and that any final decision would be attainable only after
much consultation and discussion. It seems to us that by making the committee as small
as possible while still preserving the necessary feature that its decision represent
a consensus, we shall simplify both the mental and the physical problem of coming
to an agreement. We believe that the award should if possible represent a unanimous
decision, without any minority report, and that such a requirement <span class="pagenum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>is far more likely to be met among two men than among three or five. At the same time,
the bringing together of two men and the details of general administration of their
work together are far simpler than if there were three or five. So we have finally
decided to have but two judges, and in this we have the endorsement of all the competent
opinion that we have consulted.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;The gentlemen who have consented to act as Judges are Professors Leigh Page and Edwin
Plimpton Adams, of the departments of physics of Yale and Princeton Universities,
respectively. Both are of the younger generation of physicists that has paid special
attention to those phases of mathematics and physics involved in the Einstein theories,
and both have paid special attention to these theories themselves. We are gratified
to be able to put forward as Judges two men so eminently qualified to act. We feel
that we may here appropriately quote Professor Page, who says in his acceptance: &#x2018;As
the large prize offers a great inducement, I had thought of entering the contest.
However I realize that not many people in this country have made a considerable study
of Einstein&#x2019;s theory, and if all who have should enter the contest, it would be difficult
to secure suitable Judges.&#x2019; Without any desire to put the gentleman in the position
of pleading for himself, we think this suggests very well the extent to which the
<span class="sc">Scientific American</span>, the contestants, and the public at large, are indebted to Professors Page and Adams
for their willingness to serve in the difficult capacity of Judges.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>It might appropriately have been added to this <span class="pagenum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>announcement that it was altogether to the credit of science and the scientific spirit
that the first two gentlemen approached with the invitation to act as Judges were
willing to forego their prospects as contestants in order thus to contribute to the
success of the contest.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd29e979" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Three Thousand Words</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the conditions, the one which evoked most comment was that stating the word limit.
This limit was decided upon after the most careful discussion of the possibilities
of the situation. It was not imagined for a moment that any contestant would succeed
in getting within 3,000 words a complete discussion of all aspects of the Special
and the General Theories of Relativity. It was however felt that for popular reading
a single essay should not be much if any longer than this. Moreover, I will say quite
frankly that we should never have encouraged Mr. Higgins to offer such a prize if
we had supposed that the winning essay was the only thing of value that would come
from the contest, or if we had not expected to find in many of the other essays material
which would be altogether deserving of the light. From the beginning we had in view
the present volume, and the severe restriction in length was deliberately imposed
for the purpose of forcing every contestant to stick to what he considered the most
significant viewpoints, and to give his best skill to displaying the theories of Einstein
to the utmost advantage from these viewpoints. We felt that divergent viewpoints would
<span class="pagenum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>be more advantageously treated in this manner than if we gave each contestant enough
space to discuss the subject from all sides; and that the award of the prize to the
essay which, among other requirements, seemed to the Judges to embody the best choice
of material, would greatly simplify the working of the contest without effecting any
injustice against those contestants who displayed with equal skill less happily chosen
material. Perhaps on this point I may again quote with profit the editorial page of
the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span>:
</p>
<p>&#x201c;An essay of three thousand words is not long enough to lose a reader more than once;
if it does lose him it is a failure, and if it doesn&#x2019;t it is a competitor that will
go into the final elimination trials for the prize. If we can present, as a result
of the contest, six or a dozen essays of this length that will not lose the lay reader
at all, we shall have produced something amply worth the expenditure of Mr. Higgins&#x2019;
money and our time. For such a number of essays of such character will of necessity
present many different aspects of the Einstein theories, and in many different ways,
and in doing so will contribute greatly to the popular enlightenment.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Really the significant part of what has already appeared is not the part that is
intelligible, but rather the part that, being unintelligible, casts the shadow of
doubt and suspicion on the whole. The successful competitor for the prize and his
close contestants will have written essays that, without any claim to completeness,
will emphasize what seems to each author the big outstanding feature; and every one
of them will be intelligible. Together they will <span class="pagenum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>in all probability be reasonably complete, and will retain the individual characteristic
of intelligibility. They will approach the various parts of the field from various
directions&#x2014;we could fill this page with suggestions as to how the one item of the
four-dimensional character of Einstein&#x2019;s time-space might be set forth for the general
reader. And when a man must say in three thousand words as much as he can of what
eminent scientists have said in whole volumes&#x2014;well, the result in some cases will
be sheer failure, and in others a product of the first water. The best of the essays
will shine through intelligent selection of what is to be said, and brilliant success
in saying it. It is to get a group of essays of this character, not to get the single
essay which will earn the palm, that the prize is offered.&#x201d;

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Competing Essays</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At all times after the first announcement the Einstein Editor had a heavy correspondence;
but the first real evidence that the contest was under way came with the arrival of
the first essay, which wandered into our office in the middle of September. About
a week later they began to filter in at the rate of one or two per day&#x2014;mostly from
foreign contestants who were taking no chances on the mails. Heavy returns did not
commence until about ten days before the closing date. The great avalanche, however,
was reserved for the morning of Monday, November 1st. Here we had the benefit of three
days&#x2019; mail; there were about 120 essays. Among those which were thrown out on the
ground of lateness <span class="pagenum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>the honors should no doubt go to the man who mailed his offering in The Hague on October
31st.
</p>
<p>Essays were received in greater quantity from Germany than from any other foreign
country, doubtless because of the staggering value of $5,000 when converted into marks
at late 1920 rates. England stood next on the list; and one or more essays were received
from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Jugoslavia, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark,
Italy, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, India, Jamaica, South Africa and the Fiji Islands. Canada,
of course, contributed her fair share; and few of our own states were missing on the
roll-call.
</p>
<p>The general level of English composition among the essays from non-English-speaking
sources was about what might have been expected. A man may have a thorough utilitarian
knowledge of a foreign tongue, but when he attempts intensive literary competition
with a man who was brought up in that tongue he is at a disadvantage. We read French
and German with ease and Spanish and Italian without too much difficulty, ourselves;
we should never undertake serious writing in any of these languages. Not many of the
foreign contributions, of course, were as ludicrous as the one we quote to some extent
in our concluding chapter, but most of them were distinctly below par as literary
compositions. Drs. De Sitter and Schlick were the notable exceptions to this; both
showed the ability to compete on a footing of absolute equality with the best of the
native product.
</p>
<p>We dare say it was a foregone conclusion that <span class="pagenum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>many essays should have been over the limit, and that a few should have been over
it to the point of absurdity. The winning essay contains 2,919 words, plus or minus
a reasonable allowance for error in counting; that it should come so far from being
on the ragged edge should be sufficient answer to those who protested against the
severity of the limitation. One inquirer, by the way, wanted to know if 3,000 words
was not a misprint for 30,000. Another contestant suggested that instead of disqualifying
any essay that was over the line, we amputate the superfluous words at the end. This
was a plausible enough suggestion, since any essay able to compete after such amputation
must necessarily have been one of extreme worth; but fortunately we did not have to
decide whether we should follow the scheme. Perhaps twenty of the essays submitted
were so seriously in excess of the limit that it was not even necessary to count their
words in detail; most of these offenders ran to 3,500 words or thereabouts, and one&#x2014;a
good one, too, from which we use a good deal of material in this volume&#x2014;actually had
4,700. On the other extreme were a few competitors who seemed to think that the shortest
essay was necessarily the best, and who tried to dismiss the subject with 500 or 1,000
words.
</p>
<p>By a curious trick of chance there were submitted in competition for the prize exactly
300 essays. Of course a few of these did not require serious consideration&#x2014;this is
inevitable in a contest of such magnitude. But after excluding all the essays that
were admittedly not about the Einstein theories at all, and all those whose English
was so execrable <span class="pagenum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>as to make them quite out of the question, and all those which took the subject so
lightly as not to write reasonably close to the limit of 3,000 words, and all those
which were given over to explanation of the manner in which Einstein&#x2019;s theories verify
those of the writer, and all those in which the writer attempted to substitute his
own cosmic scheme for Einstein&#x2019;s&#x2014;after all this, there remained some 275 essays which
were serious efforts to explain in simple terms the nature and content and consequences
of Special and General Relativity.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Looking for the Winner</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Einstein Editor was in sufficiently close touch with the details of the adjudication
of the essays to have every realization of the difficulty of this work. The caliber
of the essays submitted was on the whole high. There were many which would have been
well worthy of the prize in the absence of others that were distinctly better&#x2014;many
which it was not possible to eliminate on the ground of specific faults, and which
could only be adjudged &#x201c;not the best&#x201d; by detailed comparison with specific other essays.
It was this detailed comparison which took time, and which so delayed the award that
we were not able to publish the winning essay any sooner than February 5th. Especially
difficult was this process of elimination after the number of surviving essays had
been reduced to twenty or less. The advantages of plan possessed by one essay had
to be weighed against those of execution exhibited in another. A certain essay had
to be critically compared <span class="pagenum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>with another so like it in plan that the two might have been written from a common
outline, and at the same time with a third as unlike it in scope and content as day
and night. And all the time there was present in the background the consciousness
that a prize of $5,000 hung upon the decision to be reached. For anyone who regards
this as an easy task we have no worse wish than that he may some day have to attack
a similar one.
</p>
<p>We had anticipated that the bulk of the superior essays would be among those received
during the last day or two of the contest; for we felt that the men best equipped
to attack the subject would be the most impressed with its seriousness. Here we were
quite off the track. The seventeen essays which withstood most stubbornly the Judges&#x2019;
efforts at elimination were, in order of receipt, numbers 8, 18, 28, 40, 41, 43, 92,
95, 97, 130, 181, 194, 198, 223, 267, 270, 275: a fairly even distribution. The winner
was the 92nd essay received.
</p>
<p>The Judges held their final meeting in the editorial office on January 18, 1921. The
four essays which were before the committee at the start of the session were speedily
cut to three, and then to two; and after an all-day session the Judges found themselves
conscientiously able to agree on one of these as the best. This unanimity was especially
gratifying, the more so since it by no means was to be confidently expected, on <i>a priori</i> grounds, that it would be possible of attainment. Even the Einstein Editor, who might
have been called upon for a final decision but wasn&#x2019;t, can hardly be classed as a
dissenter; for with some slight mental reservations in favor of the essay by <span class="pagenum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>Mr. Francis which did not enter the Judges&#x2019; final discussion at all, and which he
rather suspects appeals more to his personal taste than to his soundest judgment,
he is entirely in accord with the verdict rendered.
</p>
<p>The fact that the prize went to England was no surprise to those acquainted with the
history of Einstein&#x2019;s theories. The Special Theory, promulgated fifteen years ago,
received its fair share of attention from mathematicians all over the world, and is
doubtless as well known and as fully appreciated here as elsewhere. But it has never
been elevated to a position of any great importance in mathematical theory, simply
because of itself, in the absence of its extension to the general case, it deserves
little importance. It is merely an interesting bit of abstract speculation.
</p>
<p>The General Theory was put out by Einstein in finished form during the war. Owing
to the scientific moratorium, his paper, and hence a clear understanding of the new
methods and results and of the sweeping consequences if the General Theory should
prevail, did not attain general circulation outside Germany until some time in 1918
or even later. Had it not been for Eddington it is doubtful that the British astronomers
would have realized that the eclipse expeditions were of particular consequence. Therefore
at the time of these expeditions, and even as late as the November announcement of
the findings, the general body of scientific men in America had not adequately realized
the immense distinction between the Special and the General Theories, had not adequately
appreciated that the latter led to <span class="pagenum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>distinctive consequences of any import, and we fear in many cases had not even realized
explicitly that the deflection of light and the behavior of Mercury were matters strictly
of the General and in no sense of the Special Theory. Certainly when the American
newspapers were searching frantically for somebody to interpret to their public the
great stir made by the British announcement that Einstein&#x2019;s predictions had been verified,
they found no one to do this decently; nor were our magazines much more successful
in spite of the greater time they had to devote to the search. In a word, there is
not the slightest room for doubt that American science was in large measure caught
asleep at the switch&#x2014;perhaps for no reason within its control; and that American writers
were in no such favorable case to write convincingly on the subject as were their
British and continental contemporaries.
</p>
<p>So it was quite in accord with what might have been expected to find, on opening the
identifying envelopes, that not alone the winning essay, but its two most immediate
rivals, come from members of that school of British thought which had been in contact
with the Einstein theories in their entirety for two years longer than the average
American of equal competence. This riper familiarity with the subject was bound to
yield riper fruit. Indeed, had it not been for the handicap of writing in a strange
language, it is reasonable to assume that the scientists of Germany would have made
a showing superior to that of either Americans or British&#x2014;and for the same reason
that Britain showed to better advantage than America.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Winner of the Prize</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mr. Bolton, the winner of the big prize, we suppose may fairly be referred to as unknown
in a strict scientific sense. Indeed, at the time of the publication of his essay
in the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span> nothing could be learned about him on the American side of the water beyond the bare
facts that he was not a young man, and that he had for a good many years occupied
a position of rank in the British Patent Office. (It will be recalled that Einstein
himself was in the Swiss Patent Office for some time.) In response to the request
of the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span> for a brief biographical sketch that would serve to introduce him better to our readers,
Mr. Bolton supplied such a concise and apparently such a characteristic statement
that we can do no better than quote it verbatim.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I was born in Dublin in 1860, but I have lived in England since 1869. My family belonged
to the landed gentry class, but I owe nothing to wealth or position. I was in fact
put through school and college on an income which a workman would despise nowadays.
After attending sundry small schools, I entered Clifton College in 1873. My career
there was checkered, but it ended well. I was always fairly good at natural science
and very fond of all sorts of mechanical things. I was an honest worker but no use
at classics, and as I did practically nothing else for the first four years at Clifton,
I came to consider myself something of a dunce. But a big public school is a little
world. Everyone gets an opportunity, often seemingly by accident, and it is <span class="pagenum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>up to him to take it. Mine did not come till I was nearly 17. As I was intended for
the engineering profession, I was sent to the military side of the school in order
to learn some mathematics, at which subject I was then considered very weak. This
was certainly true, as at that time I barely knew how to solve a quadratic, I was
only about halfway through the third book of Euclid, and I knew no trigonometry. But
the teaching was inspiring, and I took readily to mathematics. One day it came out
that I had been making quite a good start with the differential calculus on my own
without telling anybody. After that all was well. I left Clifton in 1880 with a School
Exhibition and a mathematical scholarship at Clare College, Cambridge.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;After taking my degree in 1883 as a Wrangler, I taught science and mathematics at
Wellington College, but I was attracted by what I had heard of the Patent Office and
I entered it through open competition in 1885. During my official career I have been
one of the Comptroller&#x2019;s private secretaries and I am now a Senior Examiner. During
the war I was attached to the Inventions Department of the Ministry of Munitions,
where my work related mainly to anti-aircraft gunnery. I have contributed, and am
still contributing to official publications on the subject.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I have written a fair number of essays on various subjects, even on literature, but
my only extra-official publications relate to stereoscopic photography. I read a paper
on this subject before the Royal Photographic Society in 1903 which was favorably
noticed by Dr. von Rohr of Messrs. Zeiss of Jena. <span class="pagenum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>I have also written in the <i>Amateur Photographer</i>.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I have been fairly successful at athletics, and I am a member of the Leander Club.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>That Mr. Bolton did not take the prize through default of serious competition should
be plain to any reader who examines the text from competing essays which is to be
found in this volume. The reference list of these competitors, too, supplemented by
the names that appear at the heads of complete essays, shows a notable array of distinguished
personalities, and I could mention perhaps a dozen more very well known men of science
whose excellent essays have seemed a trifle too advanced for our immediate use, but
to whom I am under a good deal of obligation for some of the ideas which I have attempted
to clothe in my own language.
</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject, we wish to say here a word of appreciation for the manner
in which the Judges have discharged their duties. The reader will have difficulty
in realizing what it means to read such a number of essays on such a subject. We were
fortunate beyond all expectation in finding Judges who combined a thorough scientific
grasp of the mathematical and physical and philosophical aspects of the matter with
an extremely human viewpoint which precluded any possibility of an award to an essay
that was not properly a popular discussion, and with a willingness to go to meet each
other&#x2019;s opinions that is rare, even among those with less ground for confidence in
their own views than is possessed by Drs. Page and Adams.

<p class="first"><span class="sc">An Introductory Discussion of the Philosophy of Relativity, and of the Mechanism of
Our Contact with Time and Space</span></p>
</div>
<p class="byline">BY VARIOUS CONTRIBUTORS AND THE EDITOR</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From a time beyond the dawn of history, mankind has been seeking to explain the universe.
At first the effort did not concern itself further probably than to make a supposition
as to what were the causes of the various phenomena presented to the senses. As knowledge
increased, first by observation and later by experiment also, the ideas as to these
causes passed progressively through three stages&#x2014;the theological (the causes were
thought to be spirits or gods); the metaphysical (the causes were thought in this
secondary or intermediate stage to be some inherent, animating, energizing principles);
and the scientific (the causes were finally thought of as simply mechanical, chemical,
and magneto-electrical attractions and repulsions, qualities or characteristics of
matter itself, or of the thing of which matter is itself composed.)
</p>
<p>With increase of knowledge, and along with the inquiry as to the nature of causes,
there arose an inquiry also as to what reality was. What was the essential nature
of the stuff of which the universe was made, what was matter, what were things in
themselves, what were the noumena (the realities), <span class="pagenum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>lying back of the phenomena (the appearances)? Gradually ideas explaining motion,
force, and energy were developed. At the same time inquiry was made as to the nature
of man, the working of his mind, the nature of thought, the relation of his concepts
(ideas) to his perceptions (knowledge gained through the sense) and the relations
of both to the noumena (realities).]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[The general direction taken by this inquiry has been that of a conflict between two
schools of thought which we may characterize as those of absolutism and of relativism.]*
[The ancient Greek philosophers believed that they could tap a source of knowledge
pure and absolute by sitting down in a chair and reasoning about the nature of time
and space, and the mechanism of the physical world.]<sup><a href="#au221">221</a></sup> [They maintained that the mind holds in its own right certain concepts than which
nothing is more fundamental. They considered it proper to conceive of time and space
and matter and the other things presented to their senses by the world as having a
real existence in the mind, regardless of whether any external reality could be identified
with the concept as ultimately put forth. They could even dispute with significance
the qualities which were to be ascribed to this abstract conceptual time and space
and matter. All this was done without reference to the external reality, often in
defiance of that reality. The mind could picture the world as it ought to be; if the
recalcitrant facts refused to fit into the picture, so much the worse for them. We
all have heard the tale of how generation after generation of Greek philosophers disputed
learnedly why and how it was <span class="pagenum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>that a live fish could be added to a brimming pail of water without raising the level
of the fluid or increasing the weight; until one day some common person conceived
the troublesome idea of trying it out experimentally to learn whether it were so&#x2014;and
found that it was not. True or false, the anecdote admirably illustrates the subordinate
place which the externals held in the absolutist system of Greek thought.]*
</p>
<p>[Under this system a single observer is competent to examine a single phenomenon,
and to write down the absolute law of nature by referring the results to his innate
ideas of absolute qualities and states. The root of the word absolute signifies &#x201c;taking
away,&#x201d; and in its philosophical sense the word implies the ability of the mind to
subtract away the properties or qualities from things, and to consider these abstract
qualities detached from the things; for example, to take away the coldness from ice,
and to consider pure or abstract coldness apart from anything that is cold; or to
take away motion from a moving body, and to consider pure motion apart from anything
that moves. This assumed power is based upon the Socratic theory of innate ideas.
According to this theory the mind is endowed by nature with the absolute ideas of
hardness, coldness, roundness, equality, motion, and all other absolute qualities
and states, and so does not have to learn them. Thus a Socratic philosopher could
discuss pure or absolute being, absolute space and absolute time.]<sup><a href="#au121">121</a></sup>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Getting Away from the Greek Ideas</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[This Greek mode of thought persisted into the <span class="pagenum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>late Middle Ages, at which time it was still altogether in order to dispose of a troublesome
fact of the external world by quoting Aristotle against it. During the Renaissance,
which intellectually at least marks the transition from ancient to modern, there came
into being another type of absolutism, equally extreme, equally arbitrary, equally
unjustified. The revolt against the mental slavery to Greek ideas carried the pendulum
too far to the other side, and early modern science as a consequence is disfigured
by what we must now recognize as gross materialism. The human mind was relegated to
the position of a mere innocent bystander. The external reality was everything, and
aside from his function as a recorder the observer did not in the least matter. The
whole aim of science was to isolate and classify the elusive external fact. The rôle
of the observer was in every possible way minimized. It was of course his duty to
get the facts right, but so far as any contribution to these was concerned he did
not count&#x2014;he was definitely disqualified. He really played the part of an intruder;
from his position outside the phenomena he was searching for the absolute truth about
these phenomena. The only difference between his viewpoint and that of Aristotle was
that the latter looked entirely inside himself for the elusive &#x201c;truth,&#x201d; while the
&#x201c;classical&#x201d; scientist, as we call him now, looked for it entirely outside himself.
</p>
<p>Let me illustrate the difference between the two viewpoints which I have discussed,
and the third one which I am about to outline, by another concrete instance. The Greeks,
and the medievals as well, were <span class="pagenum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>fond of discussing a question which embodies the whole of what I have been saying.
This question involved, on the part of one who attempted to answer it, a choice between
the observer and the external world as the seat of reality. It was put in many forms;
a familiar one is the following: &#x201c;If the wind blew down a great tree at a time and
place where there was no conscious being to hear, would there be any noise?&#x201d; The Greek
had to answer this question in the negative because to him the noise was entirely
a phenomenon of the listener. The classical scientist had to answer it in the affirmative
because to him the noise was entirely a phenomenon of the tree and the air and the
ground. Today we answer it in the negative, but for a very different reason from that
which swayed the Greek. We believe that the noise is a <i>joint phenomenon</i> of the observer and the externals, so that in the absence of <i>either</i> it must fail to take existence. We believe there are sound waves produced, and all
that; but what of it? There is no noise in the presence of the falling tree and the
absence of the observer, any more than there would be in the presence of the observer
and the absence of the tree and the wind; the noise, a joint phenomenon of the observer
and the externals, exists only in their joint presence.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Relativism and Reality</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is the viewpoint of relativism. The statue is golden for one observer and silver
to the other. The sun is rising here and setting in another part of the world. It
is raining here and clear in Chicago. The <span class="pagenum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>observer in Delft hears the bombardment of Antwerp and the observer in London does
not. If they were to be consistent, both the Greek and the medieval-modern absolutist
would have to dispute whether the statue were &#x201c;really&#x201d; golden or silver, whether the
sun were &#x201c;really&#x201d; rising or setting, whether the weather were &#x201c;really&#x201d; fair or foul,
whether the bombardment were &#x201c;really&#x201d; accompanied by loud noises or not; and on each
of these questions they would have to come to an agreement or confess their methods
inadequate. But to the relativist the answer is simple&#x2014;whether this or that be true
<i>depends upon the observer</i>. In simple cases we understand this full well, as we have always realized it. In
less simple cases we recognize it less easily or not at all, so that some of our thought
is absolutist in its tendencies while the rest is relativistic. Einstein is the first
ever to realize this fully&#x2014;or if not this, then the first ever to realize it so fully
as to be moved toward a studied effort to free human thought from the mixture of relativism
and absolutism and make it consistently the one or the other.
</p>
<p>This brings it about that the observed fact occupies a position of unexpected significance.
For when we discuss matters of physical science under a strictly relativistic philosophy,
we must put away as metaphysical everything that smacks of a &#x201c;reality&#x201d; partly concealed
behind our observations. We must focus attention upon the reports of our senses and
of the instruments that supplement them. These observations, which join our perceptions
to their external objects, afford us our only objective manifestations; them we must
accept as final&#x2014;subject always to such <span class="pagenum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>correction as more refined observations may suggest. The question whether a &#x201c;true&#x201d;
length or area or mass or velocity or duration or temperature exists back of the numerical
determination, or in the presence of a determination that is subject to correction,
or in the absence of any determination at all, is a metaphysical one and one that
the physicist must not ask. Length, area, mass, velocity, duration, temperature&#x2014;none
of these has any meaning other than the number obtained by measurement.]* [If several
different determinations are checked over and no error can be found in any of them,
the fault must lie not with the observers but with the object, which we must conclude
presents different values to different observers.]<sup><a href="#au33">33</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[We are after all accustomed to this viewpoint; we do not demand that Pittsburgh shall
present the same distance from New York and from Philadelphia, or that the New Yorker
and the Philadelphian come to any agreement as to the &#x201c;real&#x201d; distance of Pittsburgh.
The distance of Pittsburgh depends upon the position of the observer. Nor do we demand
that the man who locates the magnetic pole in one spot in 1900 and in another in 1921
come to a decision as to where it &#x201c;really&#x201d; is; we accept his statement that its position
depends upon the time of the observation.
</p>
<p>What this really means is that the distance to Pittsburgh and the position of the
magnetic pole are joint properties of the observer and the observed&#x2014;relations between
them, as we might put it. This is obvious enough in the case of the distance of Pittsburgh;
it is hardly so obvious in the case of the <span class="pagenum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>position of the magnetic pole, varying with the lapse of time. But if we reflect that
the observation of 1900 and that of 1921 were both valid, and both represented the
true position of the pole for the observer of the date in question, we must see that
this is the only explanation that shows us the way out.
</p>
<p>I do not wish to speak too definitely of the Einstein theories in these introductory
remarks, and so shall refrain from mentioning explicitly in this place the situation
which they bring up and upon which what I have just said has direct bearing. It will
be recognized when it arises. What must be pointed out here, however, is that we are
putting the thing which the scientist calls the &#x201c;observed value&#x201d; on a footing of vastly
greater consequence than we should have been willing offhand to concede to it. So
far as any single observer is concerned, his own best observed values are themselves
the external world; he cannot properly go behind the conditions surrounding his observations
and speak of a real external world beyond these observations. Any world which he may
think of as so existing is purely a conceptual world, one which for some reason he
infers to exist behind the deceptive observations. Provided he makes this reservation
he is quite privileged to speculate about this concealed world, to bestow upon it
any characteristics that he pleases; but it can have no real existence for him until
he becomes able to observe it. The only reality he knows is the one he can directly
observe.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The observations which we have been discussing, <span class="pagenum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>and which we have been trying to endow with characteristics of &#x201c;reality&#x201d; which they
are frequently not realized to possess, are the raw material of physical science.
The finished product is the result of bringing together a large number of these observations.]*
[The whole underlying thought behind the making of observations, in fact, is to correlate
as many as possible of them, to obtain some generalization, and finally to express
this in some simple mathematical form. This formulation is then called a &#x201c;law of nature.&#x201d;]<sup><a href="#au35">35</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[Much confusion exists because of a misunderstanding in the lay mind of what is meant
by a &#x201c;law of nature.&#x201d; It is perhaps not a well chosen term. One is accustomed to associate
the word law with the idea of necessity or compulsion. In the realm of nature the
term carries no such meaning. The laws of nature are man&#x2019;s imperfect attempts to explain
natural phenomena; they are not inherent in matter and the universe, not an iron bar
of necessity running through worlds, systems and suns. Laws of nature are little more
than working hypotheses, subject to change or alteration or enlargement or even abandonment,
as man&#x2019;s vision widens and deepens. No sanctity attaches to them, and if any one,
or all, of them fail to account for any part, or all, of the phenomena of the universe,
then it or they must be supplemented or abandoned.]<sup><a href="#au102">102</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[The test of one of these laws is that it can be shown to include all the related
phenomena hitherto known and that it enables us to predict new phenomena which can
then be verified. If new facts are discovered that are not in agreement with one of
<span class="pagenum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>these generalized statements, the assumptions on which the latter is based are examined,
those which are not in accordance with the new facts are given up, and the statement
is modified so as to include the new facts.]<sup><a href="#au10">10</a></sup> [And if one remembers that the laws of physics were formerly based on a range of
observations much narrower than at present available, it seems natural that in the
light of this widening knowledge one law or another may be seen to be narrow and insufficient.
New theories and laws do not necessarily disprove old ones, but explain certain discrepancies
in them and penetrate more deeply into their underlying principles, thereby broadening
our ideas of the universe. To follow the new reasoning we must rid ourselves of the
prejudice behind the old, not because it is wrong but because it is insufficient.
The universe will not be distorted to fit our rules, but will teach us the rules of
existence.]<sup><a href="#au125">125</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[Always, however, we must guard against the too easy error of <span class="corr" id="xd29e1169" title="Source: attriuting">attributing</span> to these rules anything like absolute truth.]* [The modern scientist has attained
a very business-like point of view toward his &#x201c;laws of nature.&#x201d; To him a law is fundamentally
nothing but a short-hand way of expressing the results of a large number of experiments
in a single statement. And it is important to remember that this mere shortening of
the description of a lot of diverse occurrences is by no means any real <i>explanation</i> of how and why they happened. In other words, the aim of science is not ultimately
to <i>explain</i> but only to discover the relations that hold good among physical quantities and to
embody all these relations in as few and as simple physical laws as possible.]<sup><a href="#au221">221</a></sup> [This is <span class="pagenum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>inherently the method of relativism.]* [Under it a set of phenomena is observed. There
are two or many observers, and they write down their several findings. These are reviewed
by a final observer or judge, who strains out the bias due to the different viewpoints
of the original observers. He then writes down, not any absolute law of nature governing
the observed phenomena, but a law as general as possible expressing their interrelations.]<sup><a href="#au121">121</a></sup> [And through this procedure modern science and philosophy reveal with increasing
emphasis that we superimpose our human qualities on external nature to such an extent
that]<sup><a href="#au106">106</a></sup> [we have at once the strongest practical justification, in addition to the arguments
of reason, for our insistence that the contact between objective and subjective represented
by the observation is the only thing which we shall ever be able to recognize as real.

<p class="first">[From the inquiry and criticism which have gone on for centuries has emerged the following
present-day attitude of mind toward the sum total of our knowledge. The conceptual
universe in our minds in some mysterious way parallels the real universe, but is totally
unlike it. Our conceptions (ideas) of matter, molecules, atoms, corpuscles, electrons,
the ether, motion, force, energy, space, and time stand in the same or similar relation
to reality as the x&#x2019;s and y&#x2019;s <span class="pagenum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>of the mathematician do to the entities of his problem. Matter, molecules, atoms,
corpuscles, electrons, the ether, motion, force, energy, space, and time do not exist
actually and really as we conceive them, nor do they have actually and really the
qualities and characteristics with which we endow them. The concepts are simply representations
of things outside ourselves; things which, while real, have an essential nature not
known to us. Matter, molecules, atoms, corpuscles, electrons, the ether, motion, force,
energy, space and time are merely devices, symbols, which enable us to reason about
reality. They are parts of a conceptual mechanism in our minds which operates, or
enables our minds to operate, in the same sequence of events as the sequence of phenomena
in the external universe, so that when we perceive by our senses a group of phenomena
in the external universe, we can reason out what result will flow from the interaction
of the realities involved, and thus predict what the situation will be at a given
stage in the sequence.
</p>
<p>But while our conceptual universe has thus a mechanical aspect, we do not regard the
real universe as mechanical in its nature.]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup> [This may be illustrated by a little story. Entering his friend&#x2019;s house, a gentleman
is seized unawares from behind. He turns his head but sees nothing. His hat and coat
are removed and deposited in their proper places by some invisible agent, seats and
tables and refreshments appear in due time where they are required, all without any
apparent cause. The visitor shivers with horror and asks his host for an explanation.
He is then told that the ideas &#x201c;order&#x201d; and &#x201c;regularity&#x201d; <span class="pagenum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>are at work, and that it is they who acquit themselves so well of their tasks. These
ideas cannot be seen nor felt nor seized nor weighed; they reveal their existence
only by their thoughtful care for the welfare of mankind. I think the guest, coming
home, will relate that his friend&#x2019;s house is haunted. The ghosts may be kind, benevolent,
even useful; yet ghosts they are. Now in Newtonian mechanics, absolute space and absolute
time and force and inertia and all the other apparatus, altogether imperceptible,
appearing only at the proper time to make possible a proper building up of the theory,
play the same mysterious part as the ideas &#x201c;order&#x201d; and &#x201c;regularity&#x201d; in my story. Classical
mechanics is haunted.]<sup><a href="#au116">116</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[As a matter of fact, we realize this and do not allow ourselves to be imposed upon
with regard to the true nature of these agencies.]* [We use a mechanistic terminology
and a mechanistic mode of reasoning only because we have found by experience that
they facilitate our reasoning. They are the tools which we find produce results. They
are adapted to our minds, but perhaps it would be better to say that our minds are
so constructed as to render our conceptual universe necessarily mechanical in its
aspect in order that our minds may reason at all. Two things antithetic are involved&#x2014;subject
(our perceiving mind which builds up concepts) and object (the external reality);
and having neither complete nor absolute knowledge of either, we cannot affirm which
is more truly to be said to be mechanistic in its nature, though we may suspect that
really neither is. We no longer think of cause and <span class="pagenum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>effect as dictated by inherent necessity, we simply regard them as sequences in the
routine of our sense-impressions of phenomena. In a word, we have at length grasped
the idea that our notions of reality, at present at least, whatever they may become
ultimately, are not absolute, but simply relative. We see, too, that we do not <i>explain</i> the universe, but only <i>describe</i> our perceptions of its contents.
</p>
<p>The so-called laws of nature are simply statements of formulæ which resume or sum
up the relationships and sequences of phenomena. Our effort is constantly to find
formulæ which will describe the widest possible range of phenomena. As our knowledge
increases, that is, as we perceive new phenomena, our laws or formulæ break down,
that is, they fail to afford a description in brief terms of all of our perceptions.
It is not that the old laws are untrue, but simply that they are not comprehensive
enough to include all of our perceptions. The old laws are often particular or limiting
instances of the new laws.]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[From what we have said of the reality of observations it follows that we must support
that school of psychology, and the parallel school of philosophy, which hold that
concepts originate in perceptions. But this does not impose so strong a restriction
upon conceptions as might appear. The elements of all our concepts do come to us from
outside; we manufacture nothing out of whole cloth. But when perception has supplied
a sufficient volume of raw material, we may group its elements in ways foreign to
actual occurrence in the perceptual world, and in so doing get <span class="pagenum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>conceptual results so entirely different from what we have consciously perceived that
we are strongly tempted to look upon them as having certainly been manufactured in
our minds without reference to the externals. Of even more significance is our ability
to abstract from concrete objects and concrete incidents the essential features which
make them alike and different. But unlike the Greeks, we see that our concept of coldness
is not something with which we were endowed from the beginning, but merely an abstraction
from concrete experiences with concrete objects that have been cold.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When we have formed the abstract ideas of coldness and warmth, and have had experience
indicating that the occurrence of these properties varies in degree, we are in a position
to form the secondary abstract notion covered by the word &#x201c;temperature.&#x201d; When we have
formed the abstract ideas of size and position and separation, we are similarly in
a position to form a secondary abstraction to which we give the name &#x201c;space.&#x201d; Not
quite so easy to trace to its definite source but none the less clearly an abstraction
based on experience, is our idea of what we call &#x201c;time.&#x201d; None of us are deceived as
to the reality of these abstractions.]* [We do not regard space as real in the sense
that we regard a chair as real; it is merely an abstract idea convenient for the location
of material objects like the chair.]<sup><a href="#au198">198</a></sup> [Nor do we regard time as real in this sense. Things occupy space, events occupy
time; space and time themselves we realize are immaterial and unreal; <span class="pagenum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>space does not exist and time does not happen in the same sense that material objects
exist and events occur. But we find it absolutely necessary to have, among the mental
machinery mentioned above as the apparatus by aid of which we keep track of the external
world, these vessels for that world to exist in and move in.
</p>
<p>Space and time, then, are concepts.]* [It is not strange, however, that when confronted
with the vast and bewildering complexity of the universe and the difficulty of keeping
separate and distinct in our minds our perceptions and conceptions, we should at times
and as respects certain things project our conceptions illegitimately into the perpetual
universe and mistake them for perceptions. The most notable example perhaps of this
projection has occurred in the very case of space and time, most fundamental of all
of our concepts. We got to think of these as absolute, as independent of each other
and of all other things, and as always existing and continuing to exist whether or
not we or anything else existed&#x2014;space as a three-dimensional, uniform continuum, having
the same properties in all directions; time as a one-dimensional, irreversible continuum,
flowing in one direction. It is difficult to get back to the idea that space and time
so described and defined are concepts merely, for the idea of their absolute existence
is ingrained in us as the result probably of long ancestral experience.]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[Newton&#x2019;s definitions of course represent the classical idea of time and space. He
tells us that &#x201c;absolute, true and mathematical time flows in virtue of its own nature,
uniformly and without reference <span class="pagenum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>to any external object;&#x201d; and that &#x201c;absolute space, by virtue of its own nature and
without reference to any external object, always remains the same and is immovable.&#x201d;
Of course from modern standpoints it is absurd to call either of these pronouncements
a definition; but they represent about as well as any words can the ideas which Newton
had about time and space, and they make it clear enough that he regarded both as having
real existence in the external world.
</p>
<p>If space and time are to be the vessels of our universe, and if the only thing that
really matters is measured results, it is plain enough that we must have, from the
very beginning, means of measuring space and time. Whether we believe space and time
to have real existence or not, it is obvious that we can measure neither directly.
We shall have to measure space by measuring from one material object to another; we
shall have to measure time by some similar convention based on events. We shall later
have something further to say about the measurement of time; for the present we need
only point out that]* [Newtonian time is measured independently of space; and the
existence is presupposed of a suitable timekeeper.]<sup><a href="#au10">10</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[The space of Galileo and Newton was conceived of as empty, except in so far as certain
parts of it were occupied by matter. Positions of bodies in this space were in general
determined by reference to]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup> [a &#x201c;coordinate system&#x201d; of some kind. This is again something that demands a certain
amount of discussion.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The mathematician, following the lead of the great French all-around genius, Descartes,
shows us very clearly how to set up, for the measurement of space, the framework known
as the Cartesian coordinate system. The person of most ordinary mathematical attainments
will realize that to locate a point in a plane we must have two measurements; and
we could probably show this person, without too serious difficulty, that we can locate
a point in <i>any</i> surface by two measurements. An example of this is the location of points on the
earth&#x2019;s surface by means of their latitude and longitude. It is equally clear that
if we add a third dimension and attempt to locate points in space, we must add a third
measurement. In the case of points on the earth&#x2019;s surface, this might be the elevation
above sea level, which would define the point not as part of the spherical surface
of the earth but as part of the solid sphere. Or we may fall back on Dr. Slosson&#x2019;s
suggestion that in order to define completely the position of his laboratory, we must
make a statement about Broadway, and one about 116th Street, and one telling how many
flights of stairs there are to climb. In any event, it should be clear enough that
the complete definition of a point in space calls for three measurements.
</p>
<p>The mathematician formulates all this with the utmost precision. He asks us to]* [pick
out any point whatever in space and call it <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span>. We then draw or conceive to be drawn through this point three mutually perpendicular
lines called coordinate axes, <span class="pagenum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>which we may designate <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OX</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OY</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OZ</i></span>, respectively. Finally, we consider the three planes also mutually perpendicular
like the two walls and the floor of a room that meet in one common corner, which are
formed by the lines <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OX</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OY</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OY</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OZ</i></span>, and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OZ</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OX</i></span>, respectively. These three planes are called coordinate planes. And then any other
point <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>P</i></span> in space can be represented with respect to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> by its perpendicular distances from each of the three coordinate planes&#x2014;the distances
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span> in the figure. These quantities are called the coordinates of the point.]<sup><a href="#au272">272</a></sup>

<p>[To the layman there seems something altogether naive in this notion of the scientist&#x2019;s
setting up the three sides of a box in space and using them as the basis of all his
work. The layman somehow feels that while it is perfectly all right for him to tell
us that he lives at 1065 (one coordinate) 156th Street (two coordinates) on the third
floor (three coordinates), it is rather trivial business for the serious-minded <span class="pagenum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>scientist to consider the up-and-down, the forward-and-back, the right-and-left of
every point with which he has occasion to deal. There seems to the layman something
particularly inane and foolish and altogether puerile about a set of coordinate <span class="corr" id="xd29e1335" title="Source: axis">axes</span>, and you simply can&#x2019;t make him believe that the serious-minded scientist has to monkey
with any such funny business. He can&#x2019;t be induced to take this coordinate-axis business
seriously. Nevertheless, the fact is that the scientist takes it with the utmost seriousness.
It <i>is</i> necessary for him to define the positions of points; and he <i>does</i> do it by means of a set of coordinate axes.
</p>
<p>The scientist, however, is not interested in points of empty space. The point is to
him merely part again of the conceptual machinery which he uses in his effort to run
along with the external world. He knows there are no real points, but it suits his
convenience to keep track of certain things that <i>are</i> real by representing them as points. But these things are in practically every instance
material bodies; and in practically every instance, instead of staying put in one
spot, they insist upon moving about through space. The scientist has to use his coordinate
system, not merely to define a single position of such a &#x201c;point,&#x201d; but to keep track
of the path over which it moves and to define its position in that path at given moments.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This introduces the concept of time into intimate relationship with the spatial coordinate
system. <span class="pagenum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>And at once we feel the lack of a concrete, visualized fourth dimension.]* [If we
want to fix objects in the floor alone, the edge of the room running toward the ceiling
would become unnecessary and could be dropped from our coordinate system. That is,
we need only two coordinates to fix the position of a point in a plane. Suppose instead
of discarding the third coordinate, we use it to represent units of time. It then
enables us to record the <i>time</i> it took a moving point in the floor to pass from position to position. Certain points
in the room would be vertically above the corresponding points occupied by the moving
point in its path across the floor; and the vertical height above the floor of such
points corresponds to a value of the time-coordinate which indicates the time it took
the point to move from position to position.]<sup><a href="#au152">152</a></sup> [Just as the path of the point across the floor is a continuous curve (for the mathematician,
it should be understood, this term &#x201c;curve&#x201d; includes the straight line, as a special
case in which the curvature happens to be zero); so the series of points above these
in the room forms a continuous curve which records for us, not merely the path of
the point across the floor, but in addition the time of its arrival at each of its
successive positions. In the algebraic work connected with such a problem, the third
coordinate behaves exactly the same, regardless of whether we consider it to represent
time or a third spatial dimension; we cannot even tell from the algebra what it does
represent.
</p>
<p>When we come to the more general case of a point moving freely through space, we have
but three coordinates at our disposal; there is not a fourth one <span class="pagenum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>by aid of which we can actually diagram its time-space record. Nevertheless, we can
write down the numerical and algebraic relations between its three space-coordinates
and the time which it takes to pass from one position to another; and by this means
we can make all necessary calculations. Its motion is completely defined with regard
both to space and to time. We are very apt to call attention to the fact that if we
<i>did</i> have at our disposal a fourth, space-coordinate, we could use it to represent the
time graphically, as before, and actually construct a geometric picture of the path
of our moving point with regard to space and time. And on this account we are very
apt to speak as though the time measurements constituted a fourth coordinate, regardless
of any question of our ability to construct a picture of this coordinate. The arrival
of a point in a given position constitutes an event; and this event is completely
defined by means of four coordinates&#x2014;three in space, which we can picture on our coordinate
axes, and one in time which we cannot.
</p>
<p>The set of coordinate axes in space, together with the zero point from which we measure
time, constitute what we call a frame of reference. If we are not going to pay any
attention to time, we can think of the space coordinate system alone as constituting
our reference frame. This expression appears freely throughout the subsequent text,
and always with one or the other of these interpretations.
</p>
<p>We see, then, how we can keep track of a moving point by keeping track of the successive
positions which it occupies in our reference frame.]* [Now we have implied that these
coordinate axes are fixed <span class="pagenum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>in space; but there is nothing to prevent us from supposing that they move.]<sup><a href="#au272">272</a></sup> [If they do, they carry with them all their points; and any motion of these points
which we may speak about will be merely motion with reference to the coordinate system.
If we find something outside our coordinate system that is not moving, the motion
of points in our system with regard to those outside it will be a combination of their
motion with regard to our coordinate axes and that of these axes with regard to the
external points. This will be a great nuisance; and it represents a state of affairs
which we shall try to avoid. We shall avoid it, if at all, by selecting a coordinate
system with reference to which we, ourselves, are not moving; one which partakes of
any motion which we may have. Or perhaps we shall sometimes wish to reverse the process,
in studying the behavior of some group of bodies, and seek a set of axes which is
at rest with respect to these bodies; one which partakes of any motion <i>they</i> may have.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Choice of a Coordinate Frame</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All this emphasizes the fact that our coordinate axes are not picked out for us in
advance by nature, and set down in some one particular spot. We select them for ourselves,
and we select them in the most convenient way. But different observers, or perhaps
the same observer studying different problems, will find it advantageous to utilize
different coordinate systems.]* [The astronomer has found it possible, and highly
convenient, to select a coordinate frame such that the great majority of the stars
have, on <span class="pagenum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>the whole, no motion with respect to it.]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup> [Such a system would be most unsuited for investigations confined to the earth; for
these we naturally select a framework attached to the earth, with its origin O at
the earth&#x2019;s center if our investigation covers the entire globe and at some more convenient
point if it does not, and in either event accompanying the earth in its rotation and
revolution. But such a framework, as well as the one attached to the fixed stars,
would be highly inconvenient for an investigator of the motions of the planets; he
would doubtless attach his reference frame to the sun.]<sup><a href="#au101">101</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[In this connection a vital question suggests itself. Is the expression of natural
law independent of or dependent upon the choice of a system of coordinates? And to
what extent shall we be able to reconcile the results of one observer using one reference
frame, and a second observer using a different one? The answer to the second question
is obvious.]* [True, if any series of events is described using two different sets
of axes, the descriptions will be different, depending upon the time system adopted
and the relative motion of the axes. But if the connection between the reference systems
is known, it is possible by mathematical processes to deduce the quantities observed
in one system if those observed in the other are known.]<sup><a href="#au35">35</a></sup> [This process of translating the results of one observer into those of another is
known as a transformation; and the mathematical statement of the rule governing the
transformation is called the equation or the equations (there are usually several
of them) of the transformation.]* [Transformations of this character constitute <span class="pagenum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>a well-developed branch of mathematics.]<sup><a href="#au35">35</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[When we inquire about the invariance of natural law it is necessary to be rather
sure of just what we mean by this expression. The statement that a given body is moving
with a velocity of 75 miles per hour is of course not a natural law; it is a mere
numerical observation. But aside from such numerical results, we have a large number
of mathematical relations which give us a more or less general statement of the relations
that exist between velocities, accelerations, masses, forces, times, lengths, temperatures,
pressures, etc., etc. There are some of these which we would be prepared to state
at once as universally valid&#x2014;distance travelled equals velocity multiplied by time,
for instance. We do not believe that any conceivable change of reference systems could
bring about a condition in which the product of velocity and time, as measured from
a certain framework, would fail to equal distance as measured from this same framework.
There are other relations more or less of the same sort which we probably believe
to be in the same invariant category; there are others, perhaps, of which we might
be doubtful; and presumably there are still others which we should suspect of restricted
validity, holding in certain reference systems only and not in others.
</p>
<p>The question of invariance of natural law, then, may turn out to be one which may
be answered in the large by a single statement; it may equally turn out to be one
that has to be answered in the small, by considering particular laws in connection
with particular transformations between particular reference systems. Or, perhaps,
we may find ourselves justified <span class="pagenum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>in taking the stand that an alleged &#x201c;law of nature&#x201d; is truly such a law only in the
event that it <i>is</i> independent of the change from one reference system to another. In any event, the
question may be formulated as follows:
</p>
<p>Observer A, using the reference system R, measures certain quantities <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>w</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>. Observer B, using the reference system S, measures the same items and gets the values
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>w&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z&#x2032;</i></span>. The appropriate transformation equations for calculating the one set of values from
the other is found. If a mathematical relation of any sort is found to exist between
the values <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>w</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>, will the same relation exist between the values <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>w&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z&#x2032;</i></span>? If it does not, are we justified in still calling it a law of nature? And if it
does not, and we refrain from calling it such a law, may we expect in every case to
find some relation that <i>will be</i> invariant under the transformation, and that may therefore be recognized as the natural
law connecting <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>w</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>?
</p>
<p>I have found it advisable to discuss this point in such detail because here more than
in any other single place the competing essayists betray uncertainty of thought and
sloppiness of expression. It doesn&#x2019;t amount to much to talk about the invariance of
natural laws and their persistence as we pass from one coordinate system to another,
unless we are fairly well fortified with respect to just what we mean by invariance
and by natural law. We don&#x2019;t expect the velocity of a train to be 60 miles per hour
alike when we measure it with respect to a signal tower along the line and with respect
to a moving train on the other track. We don&#x2019;t expect the <span class="pagenum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>angular displacement of Mars to change as rapidly when he is on the other side of
the sun as when he is on our side. But we do, I think, rather expect that in any phenomenon
which we may observe, we shall find a natural law of some sort which is dependent
for its validity neither upon the units we employ, nor the place from which we make
our measurements, nor anything else external to the phenomenon itself. We shall see,
later, whether this expectation is justified, or whether it will have to be discarded
in the final unravelling of the absolutist from the relativistic philosophy which,
with Einstein, we are to undertake.]*

<p class="first">When we speak of a body as being &#x201c;in motion,&#x201d; we mean that this body is changing its
position &#x201c;in space.&#x201d; Now it is clear that the position of an object can only be determined
with reference to other objects: in order to describe the place of a material thing
we must, for example<span class="corr" id="xd29e1511" title="Not in source">,</span> state its distances from other things. If there were no such bodies of reference,
the words &#x201c;position in space&#x201d; would have no definite meaning for us.]<sup><a href="#au24">24</a></sup> [The number of such external bodies of reference which it is necessary to cite in
order to define completely the position of a given body in space depends upon the
character of the space dealt with. We have seen that when we visualize the space of
our experience as a surface of any character, two citations are sufficient; and that
when we conceive of it as surrounding us in three dimensions we require three. It
will be realized that the mathematician <span class="pagenum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>is merely meeting this requirement when he sets up his system of coordinate axes to
serve as a reference frame.]*
</p>
<p>[What is true of &#x201c;place&#x201d; must be true also of &#x201c;motion,&#x201d; since the latter is nothing
but change of place. In fact, it would be impossible to ascribe a state of motion
or of rest to a body poised all alone in empty space. Whether a body is to be regarded
as resting or as moving, and if the latter at what speed, depends entirely upon the
objects to which we refer its positions in space.]<sup><a href="#au24">24</a></sup> [As Einstein sits at his desk he appears to us to be at rest; but we know that he
is moving with the rotation of the earth on its axis, with the earth in its orbit
about the sun, and with the solar system in its path through space&#x2014;a complex motion
of which the parts or the whole can be detected only by reference to appropriately
chosen ones of the heavenly bodies. No mechanical test has ever been devised which
will detect this motion,]<sup><a href="#au182">182</a></sup> [if we reserve for discussion in its proper place the Foucault pendulum experiment
which will reveal the axial rotation of our globe.]* [No savage, if he were to &#x201c;stand
still,&#x201d; could be convinced that he was moving with a very high velocity or in fact
that he was moving at all.]<sup><a href="#au30">30</a></sup> [You drop a coin straight down a ship&#x2019;s side: from the land its path appears parabolic;
to a polar onlooker it whirls circle-wise; to dwellers on Mars it darts spirally about
the sun; to a stellar observer it gyrates through the sky]<sup><a href="#au263">263</a></sup> [in a path of many complications. To you it drops in a straight line from the deck
to the sea.]* [Yet its various tracks in ship-space, sea-space, earth-space, sun-space,
star-space, are all <span class="pagenum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>equally real,]<sup><a href="#au263">263</a></sup> [and the one which will be singled out for attention depends entirely upon the observer,
and the objects to which he refers the motion.]* [The earth moves in the solar system,
which is itself approaching a distant star-cluster. But we cannot say whether we are
moving toward the cluster, or the cluster toward us,]<sup><a href="#au18">18</a></sup> [or both, or whether we are conducting a successful stern chase of it, or it of us,]*
[unless we have in mind some third body with reference to which the motions of earth
and star-cluster are measured.]<sup><a href="#au18">18</a></sup> [And if we have this, the measurements made with reference to it are of significance
with regard to it, rather than with regard to the earth and the star-cluster alone.]*
</p>
<p>[We can express all this by saying &#x201c;All motions are <i>relative</i>; there is no such thing as <i>absolute</i> motion.<span class="corr" id="xd29e1558" title="Not in source">&#x201d;</span> This line of argument has in fact been followed by many natural philosophers. But
is its result in agreement with actual experience? Is it really impossible to distinguish
between rest and motion of a body if we do not take into consideration its relations
to other objects? In fact it can easily be seen that, at least in many cases, no such
distinction is possible.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Imagine yourself sitting in a railroad car with veiled windows and running on a perfectly
straight track with unchanging velocity: you would find it absolutely impossible to
ascertain by any mechanical means whether the car were moving or not. All mechanical
instruments behave exactly the same, <span class="pagenum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>whether the car be standing still or in motion.]<sup><a href="#au24">24</a></sup> [If you drop a ball you will see it fall to the floor in a straight line, just as
though you had dropped it while standing on the station platform. Furthermore, if
you drop the ball from the same height in the two cases, and measure the velocities
with which it strikes the car floor and the station platform, or the times which it
requires for the descent, you will find these identical in the two cases.]<sup><a href="#au182">182</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[Any <i>changes</i> of speed or of direction (as when the car speeds up or slows down or rounds a curve)
can be detected by observing the behavior of bodies in the car, without apparent reference
to any outside objects. This becomes particularly obvious with sudden irregularities
of motion, which manifest themselves by shaking everything in the car. But a uniform
motion in a straight line does not reveal itself by any phenomenon within the vehicle.]<sup><a href="#au24">24</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[Moreover, if we remove the veil from our window to the extent that we may observe
the train on the adjoining track, we shall be able to make no decision as to whether
we or it be moving. This is indeed an experience which we have all had.]* [Often when
seated in a train about to leave the station, we have thought ourselves under way,
only to perceive as the motion becomes no longer uniform that another train has been
backing into the station on the adjoining track. Again, as we were hurried on our
journey, we have, raising suddenly our eyes, been puzzled to say whether the passing
train were moving with us or against us or indeed standing still; or more rarely we
have had the impression that both it and we seemed to be at rest, when in truth both
<span class="pagenum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>were moving rapidly with the same speed.]<sup><a href="#au82">82</a></sup> [Even this phrase &#x201c;in truth&#x201d; is a relative one, for it arises through using the earth
as an absolute reference body. We are indeed naive if we cannot appreciate that there
is no reason for doing this beyond convenience, and that to an observer detached from
the earth it were just as reasonable to say that the rails are sliding under the train
as that the train is advancing along the rails. One of my own most vivid childhood
recollections is of the terror with which, riding on a train that passed through a
narrow cut, I hid my head in the maternal lap to shut out the horrid sight of the
earth rushing past my window. The absence of a background in relatively slow retrograde
motion was sufficient to prevent my consciousness from drawing the accustomed conclusion
that after all it was really the train that was moving.]*

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[So we can enunciate the following principle: When a body is in uniform rectilinear
motion relatively to a second body, then all phenomena take place on the first in
exactly the same manner as on the second; the physical laws for the happenings on
both bodies are identical.]<sup><a href="#au24">24</a></sup> [And between a system of bodies, nothing but relative motion may be detected by any
mechanical means whatever; any attempt to discuss absolute motion presupposes a super-observer
on some body external to the system. Even then, the &#x201c;absolute&#x201d; motion is nothing but
motion relative to this super-observer. By no mechanical <span class="pagenum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>means is uniform straight-line motion of any other than relative character to be detected.
This is the Principle of Mechanical Relativity.
</p>
<p>There is nothing new in this. It was known to Galileo, it was known to Newton, it
has been known ever since. But the curious persistence of the human mind in habits
of thought which confuse relativity with absolutism brought about a state of affairs
where we attempted to know this and to ignore it at the same time. We shall have to
return to the mathematical mode of reasoning to see how this happened. The mathematician
has a way all his own of putting the statement of relativity which we have made. He
recalls, what we have already seen, that the observer on the earth who is measuring
his &#x201c;absolute&#x201d; motion with respect to the earth has merely attached his reference
framework to the earth; that the passenger in the train who measures all motion naively
with respect to his train is merely carrying his coordinate axes along with his baggage,
instead of leaving them on the solid ground; that the astronomer who deals with the
motion of the earth about the sun, or with that of the &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; stars against one another,
does so simply by the artifice of hitching his frame of reference to the sun or to
one of the fixed stars. So the mathematician points out that dispute as to which of
two bodies is in motion comes right down to dispute as to which of two sets of coordinate
axes is the better one, the more nearly &#x201c;natural&#x201d; or &#x201c;absolute.&#x201d; He therefore phrases
the mechanical principle of relativity as follows:
</p>
<p>Among all coordinate systems that are merely in <span class="pagenum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>uniform straight-line motion to one another, no one occupies any position of unique
natural advantage; all such systems are equivalent for the investigation of natural
laws; all systems lead to the same laws and the same results.
</p>
<p>The mathematician has thus removed the statement of relativity from its intimate association
with the external observed phenomena, and transferred it to the observer and his reference
frame. We must either accept the principle of relativity, or seek a set of coordinate
axes that have been singled out by nature as an absolute reference frame. These axes
must be in some way unique, so that when we refer phenomena to them, the laws of nature
take a form of exceptional simplicity not attained through reference to ordinary axes.
Where shall we look for such a preferred coordinate system?]*

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Search for the Absolute</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Older theory clung to the belief that there was such a thing as absolute motion in
space.]<sup><a href="#au197">197</a></sup> [As the body of scientific law developed from the sixteenth century onward, the not
unnatural hypothesis crept in, that these laws (that is to say, their mathematical
formulations rather than their verbal statements) would reveal themselves in especially
simple forms, were it possible for experimenters to make their observations from some
absolute standpoint; from an absolutely fixed position in space rather than from the
moving earth.]<sup><a href="#au264">264</a></sup> [Somewhere a set of coordinate axes incapable of motion was to be found,]<sup><a href="#au197">197</a></sup> [a fixed set of axes for measuring <span class="pagenum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>absolute motion; and for two hundred years the world of science strove to find it,]<sup><a href="#au147">147</a></sup> [in spite of what should have been assurance that it did not exist. But the search
failed, and gradually the universal applicability of the principle of relativity,
so far as it concerned mechanical phenomena, grew into general acceptance.]* [And
after the development, by the great mathematicians of the eighteenth century, of Newton&#x2019;s
laws of motion into their most complete mathematical form, it was seen that so far
as these laws are concerned the absolutist hypothesis mentioned is quite unsupported.
No complication is introduced into Newton&#x2019;s laws if the observer has to make his measurements
in a frame of reference moving uniformly through space; and for measurements in a
frame like the earth, which moves with changing speed and direction about the sun
and rotates on its axis at the same time, the complication is not of so decisive a
nature as to give us any clue to the earth&#x2019;s absolute motion in space.
</p>
<p>But mechanics, albeit the oldest, is yet only one of the physical sciences. The great
advance made in the mathematical formulation of optical and electromagnetic theory
during the nineteenth century revived the hope of discovering absolute motion in space
by means of the laws derived from this theory.]<sup><a href="#au264">264</a></sup> [Newton had supposed light to be a material emanation, and if it were so, its passage
across &#x201c;empty space&#x201d; from sun and stars to the earth raised no problem. But against
Newton&#x2019;s theory Huyghens, the Dutch astronomer, advanced the idea that light was a
wave motion of some sort. During the Newtonian period and for many years <span class="pagenum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>after, the corpuscular theory prevailed; but eventually the tables were turned.]*
[Men made rays of light interfere, producing darkness (see page 61). From this, and
from other phenomena like polarization, they had deduced that light was a form of
wave motion similar to water ripples; for these interfere, producing level surfaces,
or reinforce each other, producing waves of abnormal height. But if light were to
be regarded as a form of wave motion&#x2014;and the phenomena could apparently be explained
on no other basis&#x2014;then there must be some medium capable of undergoing this form of
motion.]<sup><a href="#au135">135</a></sup> [Transmission of waves across empty space without the aid of an intermediary material
medium would be &#x201c;action at a distance,&#x201d; an idea repugnant to us. Trammeled by our
tactual, wire-pulling conceptions of a material universe, we could not accustom ourselves
to the idea of something&#x2014;even so immaterial a something as a wave&#x2014;being transmitted
by nothing. We needed a word&#x2014;ether&#x2014;to carry light if not to shed it; just as we need
a word&#x2014;inertia&#x2014;to carry a projectile in its flight.]<sup><a href="#au231">231</a></sup> [It was necessary to invest this medium with properties to account for the observed
facts. On the whole it was regarded as the perfect fluid.]<sup><a href="#au235">235</a></sup> [The ether was imagined as an all-pervading, imponderable substance filling the vast
emptiness through which light reaches us, and as well the intermolecular spaces of
all matter. Nothing more was known definitely, yet this much served as a good working
hypothesis on the basis of which Maxwell was enabled to predict the possibility of
radio communication. By its fruits the ether hypothesis justified <span class="pagenum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>itself; but does the ether exist?]<sup><a href="#au231">231</a></sup>

<p class="first">[If it does exist, it seems quite necessary, on mere philosophical grounds, that it
shall be eligible to serve as the long-sought reference frame for absolute motion.
Surely it does not make sense to speak of a homogeneous medium filling all space,
sufficiently material to serve as a means of communication between remote worlds,
and in the next breath to deny that motion with respect to this medium is a concept
of significance.]* [Such a system of reference as was offered by the ether, coextensive
with the entire known region of the universe, must necessarily serve for all motions
within our perceptions.]<sup><a href="#au186">186</a></sup> [The conclusion seems inescapable that motion with respect to the ether ought to
be of a sufficiently unique character to stand out above all other motion. In particular,
we ought to be able to use the ether to define, somewhere, a system of axes <i>fixed with respect to the ether</i>, the use of which would lead to natural laws of a uniquely simply description.
</p>
<p>Maxwell&#x2019;s work added fuel to this hope.]* [During the last century, after the units
of electricity had been defined, one set for static electrical calculations and one
for electromagnetic calculations, it was found that the ratio of the metric units
of capacity for the two systems was numerically equal to what had already been found
as the velocity with which light is transmitted through the hypothetical ether. One
definition refers to electricity at rest, the other <span class="pagenum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>to electricity in motion. Maxwell, with little more working basis than this, undertook
to prove that electrical and optical phenomena were merely two aspects of a common
cause,]<sup><a href="#au235">235</a></sup> [to which the general designation of &#x201c;electromagnetic waves&#x201d; was applied. Maxwell
treated this topic in great fullness and with complete success. In particular, he
derived certain equations giving the relations between the various electrical quantities
involved in a given phenomenon. But it was found, extraordinarily enough, that these
relations were of such character that, when we subject the quantities involved to
a change of coordinate axes, the transformed quantities did not preserve these relations
if the new axes happened to be in motion with respect to the original ones. This,
of course, was taken to indicate that motion really <i>is</i> absolute when we come to deal with electromagnetic phenomena, and that the ether
which carries the electromagnetic waves really <i>may be</i> looked to to display the properties of an absolute reference frame.
</p>
<p>Reference to the phenomenon of aberration, which Dr. Pickering has discussed adequately
in his essay and which I need therefore mention here only by name, indicated that
the ether was not dragged along by material bodies over and through which it might
pass. It seemed that it must filter through such bodies, presumably via the molecular
interstices, without appreciable opposition. Were this not the case, we should be
in some doubt as to the possibility of observing the velocity through the ether of
material bodies; if the ether adjacent to such bodies is not dragged along or thrown
into <span class="pagenum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>eddies, but &#x201c;stands still&#x201d; while the bodies pass, there seems no imaginable reason
for anything other than the complete success of such observations. And of course these
are of the utmost importance, the moment we assign to the ether the rôle of absolute
reference frame.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One body in motion with respect to the ether is our earth itself. We do not know in
advance in what direction to expect this motion or what magnitude to anticipate that
it will have. But one thing is clear.]* [In its motion around the sun, the earth has,
at opposite points on its orbit, a difference in velocity with respect to the surrounding
medium which is double its orbital velocity with respect to the sun. This difference
comes to 37 miles per second. The earth should therefore, at some time in the year,
show a velocity equal to or greater than 18½ miles per second, with reference to the
universal medium. The famous Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 was carried out with
the expectation of observing this velocity.]<sup><a href="#au267">267</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[The ether, of course, and hence velocities through it, cannot be observed directly.
But it acts as the medium for the transmission of light.]* [If the velocity of light
through the ether is <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> and that of the earth through the ether is <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span>, then the velocity of light past the earth, so the argument runs, must vary from
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f72.3.svg" alt="upper C minus v" title="upper C minus v" class="f72.3frml"></span> to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f72.4.svg" alt="upper C plus v" title="upper C plus v" class="f72.4frml"></span>, according as the light is moving exactly in the same direction as the earth, or
in the opposite <span class="pagenum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>direction,]<sup><a href="#au182">182</a></sup> [or diagonally across the earth&#x2019;s path so as to get the influence only of a part
of the earth&#x2019;s motion. This of course assumes that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> has always the same value; an assumption that impresses one as inherently probable,
and one that is at the same time in accord with ordinary astronomical observation.
</p>
<p>It is not possible to measure directly the velocity of light (186,330 miles per second,
more or less) with sufficient accuracy to give any meaning to the variation in this
velocity which might be effected by adding or subtracting that of the earth in its
orbit (a mere 18½ miles per second). It is, however, possible to play a trick on the
light by sending it back and forth over several paths, and comparing (<i>not</i> measuring absolutely, but merely <i>comparing</i>) with great minuteness the times consumed in these several round trips.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">A Journey Upstream and Back</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The number of letters the <span class="sc">Scientific American</span> has received questioning the Michelson-Morley experiment indicates that many people
are not acquainted with the fundamental principle on which it is based. So let us
look at a simple analogous case. Suppose a swimmer or a rower make a return trip upstream
and down, contending with the current as he goes up and getting its benefit when he
comes down. Obviously, says snap judgment, since the two legs of the journey are equal,
he derives exactly as much benefit from the current when he goes with it as he suffers
handicap from it when <span class="pagenum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>he goes against it; so the round trip must take exactly the same time as a journey
of the same length in still water, the argument applying equally in the case where
the &#x201c;swimmer&#x201d; is a wave of light in the ether stream.
</p>
<p>But let us look now at a numerical case. A man can row in still water at four miles
per hour. He rows twelve miles upstream and back, in a current of two miles per hour.
At a net speed of two miles per hour he arrives at his turning point in six hours.
At a net speed of six miles per hour he makes the down-stream leg in two hours. The
elapsed time for the journey is eight hours; in still water he would row the twenty-four
miles in six hours.
</p>
<p>If we were to attempt an explanation of this result in words we should say that by
virtue of the very fact that it <i>does</i> delay him, the adverse current prolongs the time during which it operates; while
by virtue of the very fact that it accelerates his progress, the favoring current
shortens its venue. The careless observer realizes that distances are equal between
the two legs of the journey, and unconsciously <span class="corr" id="xd29e1746" title="Source: assums">assumes</span> that times are equal.
</p>
<p>If the journey be made directly with and directly against the stream of water or ether
or what not, retardation is effected to its fullest extent. If the course be a diagonal
one, retardation is felt to an extent measurable as a component, and depending for
its exact value upon the exact angle of the path. Felt, however, it must always be.
</p>
<p>Here is where we begin to get a grip on the problem of the earth and the ether. In
any problem involving the return-trip principle, there will enter <span class="pagenum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>two velocities&#x2014;that of the swimmer and that of the medium; and the time of retardation.
If we know any two of these items we can calculate the third. When the swimmer is
a ray of light and the velocity of the medium is that of the ether as it flows past
the earth, we know the first of these two; we hope to observe the retardation so that
we may calculate the second velocity. The apparatus for the experiment is ingenious
and demands description.

<p class="first">The machine is of structural steel, weighing 1,900 pounds. It has two arms which form
a Greek cross. Each arm is 14 feet in length. The whole apparatus is floated in a
trough containing 800 pounds of mercury.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p060width"><img src="images/p060.png" alt="" width="516" height="512"></div><p>
</p>
<p>Four mirrors are arranged on the end of each arm, sixteen in all, with a seventeenth
mirror, M, set at one of the inside corners of the cross, as <span class="pagenum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>diagrammed. A source of light (in this case a calcium flame) is provided, and its
rays directed by a lens toward the mirror M. Part of the light is allowed to pass
straight through M to the opposite arm of the cross, where it strikes mirror 1. It
is reflected back across the arm to mirror 2, thence to 3, and so on until it reaches
mirror 8. Thence it is reflected back to mirror 7, to 6, and so on, retracing its
former path, and finally is caught by the reverse side of the mirror M and is sent
to an observer at O. In retracing its path the light sets up an interference phenomenon
(see below) and the interference bands are visible to the observer, who is provided
with a telescope to magnify the results.
</p>
<p>A second part of the original light-beam is reflected off at right angles by the mirror
M, and is passed to and fro on the adjacent arms of the machine, in exactly the same
manner and over a similar path, by means of the mirrors I, II, <span class="corr" id="xd29e1768" title="Source: II">III</span>, &#x2026; VIII. This light finally reaches the observer at the telescope, setting up a second
set of interference bands, parallel to the first.
</p>
<p>A word now about this business of light interference. Light is a wave motion. The
length of a wave is but a few millionths of an inch, and the amplitude is correspondingly
minute; but none the less, these waves behave in a thoroughly wave-like manner. In
particular, if the crests of two waves are superposed, there is a double effect; while
if a crest of one wave falls with a trough of another, there is a killing-off or &#x201c;interference&#x201d;.
</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances interference of <span class="pagenum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>light waves does not occur. This is simply because under ordinary circumstances light
waves are not piled up on one another. But sometimes this piling up occurs; and then,
just so sure as the piled-up waves are in the same phase they reinforce one another,
while if they are in opposite phase they interfere. And the conditions which we have
outlined above, with the telescope and the mirrors and the ray of light retracing
the path over which it went out, are conditions under which interference <i>does</i> occur. If the returning wave is in exact phase with the outgoing one, the effect
is that of uniform double illumination; if it is in exactly opposite phase the effect
is that of complete extinguishing of the light, the reversed wave exactly cancelling
out the original one. If the two rays are partly in phase, there is partial reinforcement
or partial cancelling out, according to whether they are nearly in phase or nearly
out of phase. Finally, if the mirrors are not set absolutely parallel&#x2014;as must in practice
be the case when we attempt to measure their parallelism in terms of the wave-length
of light&#x2014;adjacent parts of the light ray will vary in the extent to which they are
out of phase, since they will have travelled a fraction of a wave-length further to
get to and from this, that or the other mirror. There will then appear in the telescope
alternate bands of illumination and darkness, whose width and spacing depend upon
all the factors entering into the problem.
</p>
<p>If it were possible for us to make the apparatus with such a degree of refinement
that the path from mirror M via mirrors 1, 2, 3, etc., back through M and into the
telescope, were exactly the same length <span class="pagenum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>as that from flame to telescope by way of the mirrors I, II, III, etc.&#x2014;exactly the
same to a margin of error materially less than a single wave-length of light&#x2014;why,
then, the two sets of interference fringes would come out exactly superposed provided
the motion of the earth through the &#x201c;ether&#x201d; turn out to have no influence upon the
velocity of light; or, if such influence exist, these fringes would be displaced from
one another to an extent measuring the influence in question. But our ability to set
up this complicated pattern of mirrors at predetermined distances falls far short
of the wave-length as a measure of error. So in practice all that we can say is that
having once set the instrument up, and passed a beam of light through it, there will
be produced two sets of parallel interference fringes. These sets will fail of superposition&#x2014;each
fringe of one set will be removed from the corresponding fringe of the other set&#x2014;by
some definite distance. Then, any subsequent variation in the speed of light along
the two arms will at once be detected by a shifting of the interference bands through
a distance which we shall be able to measure.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Verdict</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Under the theories and assumptions governing at the time of the original performance
of this experiment, it will be readily seen that if this machine be set up in an &#x201c;ether
stream&#x201d; with one arm parallel to the direction of the stream and the other at right
angles thereto, there will be a difference in the speed of the light along the two
arms. Then if the apparatus <span class="pagenum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>be shifted to a position oblique to the ether stream, the excess velocity of the light
in the one arm would be diminished, and gradually come to zero at the 45-degree angle,
after which the light traveling along the other arm would assume the greater speed.
In making observations, therefore, the entire apparatus was slowly rotated, the observers
walking with it, so that changes of the sort anticipated would be observed.
</p>
<p>The investigators were, however, ignorant of the position in which the apparatus ought
to be set to insure that one of the arms lie across the ether drift; and they were
ignorant of the time of year at which the earth&#x2019;s maximum velocity through the ether
was to be looked for. In particular, it is plain that if the solar system as a whole
is moving through the ether at a rate <i>less</i> than the earth&#x2019;s orbital velocity, there is a point in our orbit where our velocity
through the ether and that around the sun just cancel out and leave us temporarily
in a state of &#x201c;absolute rest.&#x201d; So it was anticipated that the experiment might have
to be repeated in many orientations of the machine and at many seasons of the year
in order to give a series of readings from which the true motion of the earth through
the ether might be deduced.
</p>
<p>For those who have a little algebra the demonstration which Dr. Russell gives on a
subsequent page will be interesting as showing the situation in perfectly general
terms. It will be realized that the more complicated arrangement of mirrors in the
experiment as just described is simply an eightfold repetition of the simple experiment
as outlined by <span class="pagenum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>Dr. Russell, and that it was done so for the mere sake of multiplying by eight the
distances travelled and hence the difference in time and in phase.
</p>
<p>And now for the grand climax. The experiment was repeated many times, with the original
and with other apparatus, indoors and outdoors, at all seasons of the year, with variation
of every condition that could imaginably affect the result. The apparatus was ordinarily
such that a shift in the fringes of anywhere from one-tenth to one one-hundredth of
that which would have followed from any reasonable value for the earth&#x2019;s motion through
the ether would have been systematically apparent. The result was uniformly negative.
At all times and in all directions the velocity of light past the earth-bound observer
was the same. The earth has no motion with reference to the ether!
</p>
<p>[The amazing character of this result is not by any possibility to be exaggerated.]*
[According to one experiment the ether was carried along by a rapidly moving body
and according to another equally well-planned and well-executed experiment a rapidly
moving body did not disturb the ether at all. This was the blind alley into which
science had been led.]<sup><a href="#au232">232</a></sup>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The &#x201c;Contraction&#x201d; Hypothesis</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Numerous efforts were made to explain the contradiction.]* [It is indeed a very puzzling
one, and it gave physicists no end of trouble. However Lorentz and Fitzgerald finally
put forward an ingenious explanation, to the effect that the actual motion of the
earth through the ether is balanced, as far <span class="pagenum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>as the ability of our measuring instruments is concerned, by a contraction of these
same instruments in the direction of their motion. This contraction obviously cannot
be observed directly because all bodies, including the measuring instruments themselves
(which after all are only arbitrary guides), will suffer the contraction equally.
According to this theory, called the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction theory,]<sup><a href="#au272">272</a></sup> [all bodies in motion suffer such contraction of their length in the direction of
their motion;]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup> [the contraction being made evident by our inability to observe the absolute motion
of the earth, which it is assumed must exist.]<sup><a href="#au272">272</a></sup> [This would suffice to show why the Michelson-Morley experiment gave a negative result,
and would preserve the concept of absolute motion with reference to the ether.]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[This proposal of Lorentz and Fitzgerald loses its startling aspect when we consider
that all matter appears to be an electrical structure, and that the dimensions of
the electric and magnetic fields which accompany the electrons of which it is constituted
change with the velocity of motion.]<sup><a href="#au267">267</a></sup> [The forces of cohesion which determine the form of a rigid body are held to be electromagnetic
in nature; the contraction may be regarded as due to a change in the electromagnetic
forces between the molecules.]<sup><a href="#au10">10</a></sup> [As one writer has put it, the orientation, in the electromagnetic medium, of a body
depending for its very existence upon electromagnetic forces is not necessarily a
matter of indifference.]*
</p>
<p>[Granting the plausibility of all this, on the basis of an electromagnetic theory
of matter, it leaves us <span class="pagenum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>in an unsatisfactory position. We are left with a fixed ether with reference to which
absolute motion has a meaning, but that motion remains undetected and apparently undetectable.
Further, if we on shore measure the length of a moving ship, using a yard-stick which
is stationary on shore, we shall obtain one result. If we take our stick aboard it
contracts, and so we obtain a greater length for the ship. Not knowing our &#x201c;real&#x201d;
motion through the ether, we cannot say which is the &#x201c;true&#x201d; length. Is it not, then,
more satisfactory to discard all notion of true length as an inherent quality of bodies,
and, by regarding length as the measure of a relation between a particular object
and a particular observer, to make one length as true as the other?]<sup><a href="#au182">182</a></sup> [The opponents of such a viewpoint contend that Michelson&#x2019;s result was due to a fluke;
some mysterious counterbalancing influence was for some reason at work, concealing
the result which should normally have been expected. Einstein refuses to accept this
explanation;]<sup><a href="#au192">192</a></sup> [he refuses to believe that all nature is in a contemptible conspiracy to delude
us.]*
</p>
<p>[The Fitzgerald suggestion is further unsatisfactory because it assumes all substances,
of whatever density, to undergo the same contraction; and above all for the reason
that it sheds no light upon other phenomena.]<sup><a href="#au194">194</a></sup> [It is indeed a very <i>special</i> explanation; that is, it applies only to the particular experiment in question. And
indeed it is only one of many <i>possible</i> explanations. Einstein conceived the notion that it might be infinitely more valuable
to take the most general explanation possible, and then try to find from this its
logical consequences. This &#x201c;most <span class="pagenum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>general explanation&#x201d; is, of course, simply that it is impossible in any way whatever
to measure the absolute motion of a body in space.]<sup><a href="#au272">272</a></sup> [Accordingly Einstein enunciated, first the Special Theory of Relativity, and later
the General Theory of Relativity. The special theory was so called because it was,
limited to uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motions. The general theory, on the
other hand, dealt not only with uniform rectilinear motions, but with any arbitrary
motion whatever.

<p class="first">The hypothesis of relativity asserts that there can be no such concept as absolute
position, absolute motion, absolute time; that space and time are inter-dependent,
not independent; that everything is relative to something else. It thus accords with
the philosophical notion of the relativity of all knowledge.]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup> [Knowledge is based, ultimately, upon measurement; and clearly all measurement is
relative, consisting merely in the application of a standard to the magnitude measured.
All metric numbers are relative; dividing the unit multiplies the metric number. Moreover,
if measure and measured change proportionately, the measuring number is unchanged.
Should space with all its contents swell in fixed ratio throughout, no measurement
could detect this; nor even should it <i>pulse</i> uniformly throughout. Furthermore, were space and space-contents in any way systematically
<i>transformed</i> (as by reflection in curved mirrors) point for point, continuously, without rending,
no measurement <span class="pagenum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>could reveal this distortion; experience would proceed undisturbed.]<sup><a href="#au263">263</a></sup>

<p>[Mark Twain said that the street in Damascus &#x201c;which is called straight,&#x201d; is so called
because while it is not as straight as a rainbow it is straighter than a corkscrew.
This expresses the basic idea of relativity&#x2014;the idea of <i>comparison</i>. All our knowledge is <i>relative</i>, not <i>absolute</i>. Things are big or little, long or short, light or heavy, fast or slow, only by comparison.
An atom may be as large, compared to an electron, as is a cathedral compared to a
fly. The relativity theory of Einstein emphasizes two cases of relative knowledge;
our knowledge of <i>time and space</i>, and our knowledge of <i>motion</i>.]<sup><a href="#au216">216</a></sup> [And in each case, instead of allowing the notions of relativity to guide us only
so far as it pleases us to follow them, there abandoning them for ideas more in accord
with what we find it easy to take for granted, Einstein builds his structure on the
thesis that relativity must be admitted, must be followed out to the bitter end, in
spite of anything that it may do to our preconceived notions. If relativity is to
be admitted at all, it must be admitted <i>in toto</i>; no matter what else it contradicts, we have no appeal from its conclusions so long
as it refrains from contradicting itself.]*
</p>
<p>[The hypothesis of relativity was developed by Einstein through <i>a priori</i> methods, not the more usual <i>a posteriori</i> ones. That is, certain principles were enunciated as probably true, the consequences
of these were developed, and these deductions tested by comparison of the predicted
and the observed phenomena. It was in no sense attained by the <span class="pagenum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>more usual procedure of observing groups of phenomena and formulating a law or formula
which would embrace them and correctly describe the routine or sequence of phenomena.
</p>
<p>The first principle thus enunciated is that it is impossible to measure or detect
absolute translatory motion through space, under any circumstances or by any means.
The second is that the velocity of light in free space appears the same to all observers
regardless of the relative motion of the source of light and the observer. This velocity
is not affected by motion of the source toward or away from the observer,]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup> [if we may for the moment use this expression with its implication of absolute motion.]*
[But universal relativity insists that motion of the source toward the observer is
identical with motion of the observer toward the source.]<sup><a href="#au283">283</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[It will be seen that we are at once on the horns of a dilemma. Either we must give
up relativity before we get fairly started on it, or we must overturn the foundations
of common sense by admitting that time and space are so constituted that when we go
to meet an advancing light-impulse, or when we retreat from it, it still reaches us
with the same velocity as though we stood still waiting for it. We shall find when
we are through with our investigation that common sense is at fault; that our fixed
impression of the absurdity of the state of affairs just outlined springs from a confusion
between relativism and absolutism which has heretofore dominated our thought and gone
unquestioned. The impression of absurdity will vanish when we have resolved this confusion.]*

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[But it is obvious from what has just been said that if we are to adopt Einstein&#x2019;s
theory, we must make very radical changes in some of our fundamental notions, changes
that seem in violent conflict with common sense. It is unfortunate that many popularizers
of relativity have been more concerned to astonish their readers with incredible paradoxes
than to give an account such as would appeal to sound judgment. Many of these paradoxes
do not belong essentially to the theory at all. There is nothing in the latter that
an enlarged and enlightened common sense would not readily endorse. But common sense
must be educated up to the necessary level.]<sup><a href="#au141">141</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[There was a time when it was believed, as a result of centuries of experience, that
the world was flat. This belief checked up with the known facts, and it could be used
as the basis for a system of science which would account for things that had happened
and that were to happen. It was entirely sufficient for the time in which it prevailed.
</p>
<p>Then one day a man arose to point out that all the known facts were equally accounted
for on the theory that the earth was a sphere. It was in order for his contemporaries
to admit this, to say that so far as the facts in hand were concerned they could not
tell whether the earth was flat or round&#x2014;that new facts would have to be sought that
would contradict one or the other hypothesis. Instead of this the world laughed and
insisted that the earth could not be round because it was flat; that it could <span class="pagenum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>not be round because then the people would fall off the other side.
</p>
<p>But the field of experimentation widened, and men were able to observe facts that
had been hidden from them. Presently a man sailed west and arrived east; and it became
clear that in spite of previously accepted &#x201c;facts&#x201d; to the contrary, the earth was
really round. The previously accepted &#x201c;facts&#x201d; were then revised to fit the newly discovered
truth; and finally a new system of science came into being, which accounted for all
the old facts and all the new ones.
</p>
<p>At intervals this sort of thing has been repeated. A Galileo shows that preconceived
ideas with regard to the heavens are wrong, and must be revised to accord with his
newly promulgated principles. A Newton does the same for physics&#x2014;and people unlearn
the &#x201c;fact&#x201d; that motion has to be supported by continued application of force, substituting
the new idea that it actually requires force to stop a moving body. A Harvey shows
that the things which have been &#x201c;known&#x201d; for generations about the human body are not
so. A Lyell and a Darwin force men to throw overboard the things they have always
believed about the way in which the earth and its creatures came into being. Every
science we possess has passed through one or more of these periods of readjustment
to new facts.

<p class="first">Now we are apt to lose sight of the true significance of this. It is not alone our
opinions that are <span class="pagenum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>altered; it is our fundamental concepts. <i>We get concepts wholly from our perceptions</i>, making them to fit those perceptions. Whenever a new vista is opened to our perceptions,
we find facts that we never could have suspected from the restricted viewpoint. We
must then actually alter our concepts to make the new facts fit in with the greatest
degree of harmony. And we must not hesitate to undertake this alteration, through
any feeling that fundamental concepts are more sacred and less freely to be tampered
with than derived facts.]* [We do, to be sure, want fundamental concepts that are
easy for a human mind to conceive; but we also want our laws of nature to be simple.
If the laws begin to become, intricate, why not reshape, somewhat, the fundamental
concepts, in order to simplify the scientific laws? Ultimately it is the simplicity
of the scientific system as a whole that is our principal aim.]<sup><a href="#au178">178</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[As a fair example, see what the acceptance of the earth&#x2019;s sphericity did to the idea
represented by the word &#x201c;down.&#x201d; With a flat earth, &#x201c;down&#x201d; is a single direction, the
same throughout the universe; with a round earth, &#x201c;down&#x201d; becomes merely the direction
leading toward the center of the particular heavenly body on which we happen to be
located. It is so with every concept we have. No matter how intrinsic a part of nature
and of our being a certain notion may seem, we can never know that new facts will
not develop which will show it to be a mistaken one. Today we are merely confronted
by a gigantic example of this sort of thing. Einstein tells us that when velocities
are attained which have just now come within the range of our close investigation,
<span class="pagenum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>extraordinary things happen&#x2014;things quite irreconcilable with our present concepts
of time and space and mass and dimension. We are tempted to laugh at him, to tell
him that the phenomena he suggests are absurd because they contradict these concepts.
Nothing could be more rash than this.
</p>
<p>When we consider the results which <span class="corr" id="xd29e1964" title="Source: follows">follow</span> from physical velocities comparable with that of light, we must confess that here
are conditions which have never before been carefully investigated. We must be quite
as well prepared to have these conditions reveal some epoch-making fact as was Galileo
when he turned the first telescope upon the skies. And if this fact requires that
we discard present ideas of time and space and mass and dimension, we must be prepared
to do so quite as thoroughly as our medieval fathers had to discard their notions
of celestial &#x201c;perfection&#x201d; which demanded that there be but seven major heavenly bodies
and that everything center about the earth as a common universal hub. We must be prepared
to revise our concepts of these or any other fundamentals quite as severely as did
the first philosopher who realized that &#x201c;down&#x201d; in London was not <span class="corr" id="xd29e1967" title="Source: parellel">parallel</span> to &#x201c;down&#x201d; in Bagdad or on Mars.]*
</p>
<p>[In all ordinary terrestrial matters we take the earth as a fixed body, light as instantaneous.
This is perfectly proper, for such matters. But we carry our earth-acquired habits
with us into the celestial regions. Though we have no longer the earth to stand on,
yet we assume, as on the earth, that all measurements and movements must be referred
to some fixed body, and are only then valid. We <span class="pagenum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>cling to our earth-bound notion that there <i>is</i> an absolute up-and-down, back-and-forth, right-and-left, in space. We may admit that
we can never find it, but we still <i>think it is there</i>, and seek to approach it as nearly as possible. And similarly from our earth experiences,
which are sufficiently in a single place to make possible this simplifying assumption,
we get the idea that there is <i>one</i> universal time, applicable at once to the entire universe.]<sup><a href="#au141">141</a></sup> [The difficulty in accepting Einstein is entirely the difficulty in getting away

<p class="first">Whatever the explanation adopted for the negative result of the Michelson-Morley experiment,
one thing stands out clearly: the attempt to isolate absolute motion has again failed.]*
[Einstein generalizes this with all the other and older negative results of similar
sort into a negative deduction to the effect that no experiment is possible upon two
systems which will determine that one of them is in motion and the other at rest.]<sup><a href="#au121">121</a></sup> [He elevates the repeated failure to detect absolute motion through space into the
principle that experiment will never reveal anything in the nature of absolute velocities.
He postulates that all laws of nature can and should be enunciated in such forms that
they are as true in these forms for one observer as for another, even though these
observers with their frames of reference be in motion relative to one another.]<sup><a href="#au264">264</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[There are various ways of stating the principle of the relativity of uniform motion
which has been <span class="pagenum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>thus arrived at, and which forms the basis of the Special Theory of Einstein. If we
care to emphasize the rôle of mathematics and the reference frame we may say that]*
[any coordinate system having a uniform rectilinear motion with respect to the bodies
under observation may be interchangeably used with any other such system in describing
their motions;]<sup><a href="#au232">232</a></sup> [or that the unaccelerated motion of a system of reference cannot be detected by
observations made on this system alone.]<sup><a href="#au194">194</a></sup> [Or we can let this aspect of the matter go, and state the relativity postulate in
a form more intelligible to the non-mathematician by simply insisting that it is impossible
by any means whatever to distinguish any other than the relative motion between two
systems that are moving uniformly. As Dr. Russell puts it on a later page, we can
assume boldly that the universe is so constituted that uniform straight-ahead motion
of an observer and all his apparatus will not produce any difference whatever in the
result of any physical process or experiment of any kind.
</p>
<p>As we have seen, this is entirely reasonable, on philosophical grounds, until we come
to consider the assumptions of the past century with regard to light and its propagation.
On the basis of these assumptions we had expected the Michelson-Morley experiment
to produce a result negativing the notion of universal relativity. It refused to do
this, and we agree with Einstein that the best explanation is to return to the notion
of relativity, rather than to invent a forced and special hypothesis to account for
the experiment&#x2019;s failure. But we must now investigate <span class="pagenum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>the assumptions underlying the theory of light, and remove the one that requires the
ether to serve as a universal standard of absolute motion.

<p class="first">It is among the possibilities that the wave theory of light itself will in the end
be more or less seriously modified. It is even more definitely among the possibilities
that the ether will be discarded.]* [Certainly when Lord Kelvin estimates that its
mass per cubic centimeter is .000,000,000,000,000,001 gram, while Sir Oliver Lodge
insists that the correct figure is 1,000,000,000,000,000 grams, it is quite evident
that we know so little about it that it is better to get along without it if we can.]<sup><a href="#au216">216</a></sup> [But to avoid confusion we must emphasize that Einstein makes no mention whatsoever
of the ether; his theory is absolutely independent of any theory of the ether.]<sup><a href="#au139">139</a></sup> [Save as he forbids us to employ the ether as a standard of absolute motion, Einstein
does not in the least care what qualities we assign to it, or whether we retain it
at all. His demands are going to be made upon light itself, not upon the alleged medium
of light transmission.
</p>
<p>When two observers in relative motion to one another measure their velocities with
respect to a third material object, they expect to get different results. Their velocities
with regard to this object properly differ, for it is no more to be taken as a universal
super-observer than either of them. But if they get different results when they come
to measure the velocity with which light passes their respective <span class="pagenum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>systems, relativity is challenged. Light <i>is</i> with some propriety to be regarded as a universal observer; and if it will measure
our velocities against each other we cannot deny it rank as an absolute standard.
If we are not prepared to abandon universal relativity, and adopt one of the &#x201c;fluke&#x201d;
explanations for the Michelson-Morley result, we must boldly postulate that in free
space light presents the same velocity <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> to all observers&#x2014;whatever the source of the light, whatever the relative motion between
source and observer, whatever the relative motion between the several observers. The
departure here from the old assumption lies in the circumstance that the old physics
with its ether assigned to light a velocity universally constant <i>in this ether</i>; we have stopped talking about the medium and have made the constant <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> refer to the observer&#x2019;s measured value of the velocity of light with regard to himself.
</p>
<p>We are fortified in this assumption by the Michelson-Morley result and by all other
observations bearing directly upon the matter. Nevertheless, as Mr. Francis says in
his essay, we feel instinctively that space and time are not so constituted as to
make it possible, if I pass you at 100 miles per hour, for the same light-impulse
to pass us both at the same speed <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>.]* [The implicit assumptions underlying this feeling, be they true or false, are
now so interwoven with the commonly received notions of space and time that any theory
which questions them has all the appearance of a fantastic and unthinkable thing.]<sup><a href="#au115">115</a></sup> [We cannot, however, go back on our relativity; so when]* [Einstein shows us that

to them.]*
</p>
<p>[The conceptual difficulties of the theory arise principally from attributing to space
and time the properties of things. No portion of space can be compared with another,
save by convention; it is things which we compare. No interval of time can be compared
with another, save by convention. The first has gone when the second becomes &#x201c;now&#x201d;.]<sup><a href="#au149">149</a></sup> [It is events that we compare, through the intervention of things. Our measurements
are never of space or of time, but only of the things and the events that occupy space
and time. And since the measurements which we deal with as though they were of space
and of time lie at the foundation of all physical science, while at the same time
themselves constituting, as we have seen, the only reality of which we are entitled
to speak, it is in order to examine with the utmost care the assumptions underlying
them. That there are such assumptions is clear&#x2014;the very possibility of making measurements
is itself an assumption, and every technique for carrying them out rests on an assumption.
Let us inquire which of these it is that relativity asks us to revise.]*

<p class="first">[Time is generally conceived as perfectly uniform. <span class="pagenum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>How do we judge about it? What tells us that the second just elapsed is equal to the
one following? By the very nature of time the superposition of its successive intervals
is impossible. How then can we talk about the relative duration of these intervals?
It is clear that any relationship between them can only be conventional.]<sup><a href="#au178">178</a></sup> [As a matter of fact, we habitually measure time in terms of moving bodies. The simplest
method is to agree that some entity moves with uniform velocity. It will be considered
as travelling equal distances in equal intervals of time, the distances to be measured
as may be specified by our assumptions governing this department of investigation.]<sup><a href="#au179">179</a></sup> [The motions of the earth through which we ultimately define the length of day and
year, the division of the former into 86,400 &#x201c;equal&#x201d; intervals as defined by the motions
of pendulum or balance wheel through equal distances, are examples of this convention
of time measurement. Even when we correct the motions of the earth, on the basis of
what our clocks tell us of these motions, we are following this lead; the earth and
the clocks fall out, it is plain that one of them does not satisfy our assumption
of equal lengths in equal times, and we decide to believe the clock.]*
</p>
<p>[The foregoing concerning time may be accepted as inherent in time itself. But concerning
lengths it may be thought that we are able to verify absolutely their equality and
especially their invariability. Let us have the audacity to verify this statement.
We have two lengths, in the shape of two rods, which coincide perfectly when brought
together. What may we conclude from this coincidence? Only that <span class="pagenum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>the two rods so considered have equal lengths at the same place in space and at the
same moment. It may very well be that each rod has a different length at different
locations in space and at different times; that their equality is purely a local matter.
Such changes could never be detected if they affected all objects in the universe.
We cannot even ascertain that both rods remain straight when we transport them to
another location, for both can very well take the same curvature and we shall have
no means of detecting it.
</p>
<p>Euclidean geometry assumes that geometrical objects have sizes and shapes independent
of position and of orientation in space, and equally invariable in time. But the properties
thus presupposed are only conventional and in no way subject to direct verification.
We cannot even ascertain space to be independent of time, because when comparing geometrical
objects we have to conceive them as brought to the same place in space and in time.]<sup><a href="#au178">178</a></sup> [Even the statement that when they are made to coincide their lengths are equal is,
after all, itself an assumption inherent in our ideas of what constitutes length.
And certainly the notion that we can shift them from place to place and from moment
to moment, for purposes of comparison, is an assumption; even Euclid, loose as he
was from modern standards in this business of &#x201c;axioms,&#x201d; knew this and included a superposition
axiom among his assumptions.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, this procedure for determining equality of lengths is not always
available. It assumes, it will be noted, that we have free access to the object which
is to be measured&#x2014;which is to <span class="pagenum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>say, it assumes that this object is at rest with respect to us. If it is not so at
rest, we must employ at least a modification of this method; a modification that will
in some manner involve the sending of signals. Even when we employ the Euclidean method
of superposition directly, we must be assured that the respective ends of the lengths
under comparison coincide at the same time. The observer cannot be present at both
ends simultaneously; at best he can only be present at one end and receive a signal
from the other end.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Problem of Communication</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Accordingly, in making the necessary assumptions to cover the matter of measuring
lengths, we must make one with regard to the character of the signals which are to
be employed for this purpose. If we could assume a system of signalling that would
consume no time in transmission all would be simple enough. But we have no experience
with such a system. Even if we believe that it ought to be possible thus to transmit
signals at infinite velocity, we may not, in the absence of our present ability to
do this, assume that it is possible. So we may only assume, with Einstein, that for
our signals we shall employ the speediest messenger with which we are at present acquainted.
This of course is light, the term including any of the electromagnetic impulses that
travel at the speed <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>.
</p>
<p>Of course in the vast majority of cases the distance that any light signal in which
we are interested must go to reach us is so small that the time taken <span class="pagenum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>by its transmission can by no means be measured. We are then, to all intents and purposes,
at both places&#x2014;the point of origin of the signal and the point of receipt&#x2014;simultaneously.
But this is not the question at all. Waiving the fact that in astronomical investigations
this approximation no longer holds, the fact remains that it is, in every case, merely
an approximation. Approximations are all right in observations, where we know that
they are approximations and act accordingly. But in the conceptual universe that parallels
the external reality, computation is as good an agent of observation as visual or
auditory or tactile sensation; if we can compute the error involved in a wrong procedure
the error is there, regardless of whether we can see it or not. We must have methods
which are conceptually free from error; and if we attempt to ignore the velocity of
our light signals we do not meet this condition.
</p>
<p>The measurement of lengths demands that we have a criterion of simultaneity between
two remote points&#x2014;remote in inches or remote in light-years, it does not matter which.
There is no difficulty in defining simultaneity of two events that fall in the same
point&#x2014;or rather, in agreeing that we know what we mean by such simultaneity. But with
regard to two events that occur in remote places there may be a question. A scientific
definition differs from a mere description in that it must afford us a means of testing
whether a given item comes under the definition or not. There is some difficulty in
setting up a definition of simultaneity between distant events that satisfies this
requirement. If we <span class="pagenum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>try simply to fall back upon our inherent ideas of what we mean by &#x201c;the same instant&#x201d;
we see that this is not adequate. We must lay down a procedure for determining whether
two events at remote points occur at &#x201c;the same instant,&#x201d; and check up alleged simultaneity
by means of this procedure.
</p>
<p>Einstein says, and we must agree with him, that he can find but one reasonable definition
to cover this ground. An observer can tell whether he is located half way between
two points of his observation; he can have mirrors set up at these points, send out
light-signals, and note the time at which he gets back the reflection. He knows that
the velocity of both signals, going and coming, is the same; if he observes that they
return to him together so that their time of transit for the round trip is the same,
he must accept the distances as equal. He is then at the mid-point of the line joining
the two points under observation; and he may define simultaneity as follows, without
introducing anything new or indeterminate: Two events are simultaneous if an observer
midway between them sees them at the same instant, by means, of course, of light originating
at the points of occurrence.]*
</p>
<p>[It is this definition of simultaneity, coupled with the assumption that all observers,
on whatever uniformly moving systems, would obtain the same experimental value for
the velocity of light, that leads to the apparent paradoxes of the Special Theory
of Relativity. If it be asked why we adopt it, we must in turn ask the inquirer to
propose a better system for defining simultaneous events on different moving bodies.]<sup><a href="#au198">198</a></sup>
<span class="pagenum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>[There is nothing in this definition to indicate, directly, whether simultaneity persists
for all observers, or whether it is relative, so that events simultaneous to one observer
are not so to another. The question must then be investigated; and the answer, of
course, will hinge upon the possibility of making proper allowances for the time of
transit of the light signals that may be involved. It seems as though this ought to
be possible; but a simple experiment will indicate that it is not, unless the observers
involved are at rest with respect to one another.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us imagine an indefinitely long, straight railroad track, with an observer located
somewhere along it at the point <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>. According to the convention suggested above, he has determined points <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> in opposite directions from him along the
</p>
<div class="figure p086width"><img src="images/p086.png" alt="" width="577" height="120"></div><p>
track, and equally distant from him. We shall imagine, further, than a beneficent
Providence supplies two lightning flashes, one striking at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> and one at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>, in such a way that observer <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> finds them to be simultaneous.
</p>
<p>While all this is going on, a train is passing&#x2014;a very long train, amply long enough
to overlap the section <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>AMB</i></span> of the track. Among the passengers <span class="pagenum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>there is one, whom we may call <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span>, who is directly opposite <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> at the instant when, according to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>, the lightning strikes. Observe he is not opposite <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> when <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> <i>sees</i> the flashes, but a brief time earlier&#x2014;at the instant when, according to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>&#x2019;s computation, the simultaneous flashes <i>occurred</i>. At this instant there are definitely determined the points <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A&#x2032;</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B&#x2032;</i></span>, on the train; and since we may quite well think of the two systems&#x2014;train-system
and track-system&#x2014;as in coincidence at this instant, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span> is midway between <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A&#x2032;</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B&#x2032;</i></span>, and likewise is midway between <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>.
</p>
<p>Now if we think of the train as moving over the track in the direction of the arrow,
we see very easily that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span> is running away from the light from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> and toward that from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>, and that, despite&#x2014;or if you prefer because of&#x2014;the uniform velocity of these light
signals, the one from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> reaches him, over a slightly shorter course, sooner than the one from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>, over the slightly longer course. When the light signals reach <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span> is no longer abreast of him but has moved along a wee bit, so that at this instant
when <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> has the two signals, one of these has passed <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span> and the other has yet to reach him. The upshot is that the events which were simultaneous
to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> are not so to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span>.
</p>
<p>It will probably be felt that this result is due to our having, somewhat unjustifiably
and inconsistently, localized <i>on the train</i> the relative motion between train and track. But if we think of the track as sliding
back under the train in the direction opposite to the arrow, and carrying with it
the points <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>; and if we remember that this in no way <span class="pagenum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>affects <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>&#x2019;s observed velocity of light or the distances <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>AM</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>BM</i></span> as he observes them: we can still accept his claim that the flashes were simultaneous.
Then we have again the same situation: when the flashes from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> and from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> reach <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> at the same moment, in his new position a trifle to the left of his initial position
of the diagram, the flash from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> has not yet reached <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span> in his original position while that from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> has passed him. Regardless of what assumption we make concerning the motion between
train-system and track-system, or more elegantly regardless of what coordinate system
we use to define that motion, the event at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> precedes that at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> in the observation of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span>. If we introduce a second train moving on the other track in the opposite direction,
the observer on it will of course find that the flash at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> precedes that at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>&#x2014;a disagreement not merely as to simultaneity but actually as to the order of two
events! If we conceive the lightning as striking at the points <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A&#x2032;</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B&#x2032;</i></span> <i>on the train</i>, these points travel with <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span> instead of with <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>; they are fixed to his coordinate system instead of to the other. If you carry out
the argument now, you will find that when the flashes are simultaneous to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span>, the one at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> precedes that at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>&#x2019;s observation.
</p>
<p>A large number of experiments more or less similar in outline to this one can be set
up to demonstrate the consequences, with regard to measured values of time and space,
of relative motion between two observers. I do not believe that a multiplicity of
such demonstrations contributes to the intelligibility of the subject, and it is for
this reason that I have cut loose from immediate dependence upon <span class="pagenum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>the essayists in this part of the discussion, concentrating upon the single experiment
to which Einstein himself gives the place of importance.

<p class="first">We may permit Mr. Francis to remind us here that neither <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> nor <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M&#x2032;</i></span> may correct his observation to make it accord with the other fellow&#x2019;s. The one who
does this is admitting that the other is at absolute rest and that he is himself in
absolute motion; and this cannot be. They are simply in disagreement as to the simultaneity
of two events, just as two observers might be in disagreement about the distance or
the direction of a single event. This can mean nothing else than that, under the assumptions
we have made, simultaneity is not an absolute characteristic as we had supposed it
to be, but, like distance and direction, is in fact merely a relation between observer
and objective, and therefore depends upon the particular observer who happens to be
operating and upon the reference frame he is using.
</p>
<p>But this is serious. My time measurements depend ultimately upon my space measurements;
the latter, and hence both, depend closely upon my ideas of simultaneity. Yours depend
upon your reading of simultaneity in precisely the same way.]* [Suppose the observer
on the track, in the above experiment, wants to measure the length of something on
the car, or the observer on the car something on the track. The observer, or his assistant,
must be at both ends of the length to be measured at the same time, or get simultaneous
reports in some way from <span class="pagenum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>these ends; else they will obtain false results. It is plain, then, that with different
criteria of what the &#x201c;same time&#x201d; is, the observers in the two systems may get different
values for the measured lengths in question.]<sup><a href="#au220">220</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[Who is right? According to the principle of relativity a decision on this question
is absolutely impossible. Both parties are right from their own points of view; and
we must admit that two events in two different places may be simultaneous for certain
observers, and yet not simultaneous for other observers who move with respect to the
first ones. There is no contradiction in this statement, although it is not in accordance
with common opinion, which believes simultaneousness to be something absolute. But
this common opinion lacks foundation. It cannot be proved by direct perception, for
simultaneity of events can be perceived directly,]<sup><a href="#au24">24</a></sup> [and in a manner involving none of our arbitrary assumptions,]* [only if they happen
at the same place; if the events are distant from each other, their simultaneity or
succession can be stated only through some method of communicating by signals. There
is no logical reason why such a method should not lead to different results for observers
who move with regard to one another.
</p>
<p>From what we have said, it follows immediately that in the new theory not only the
concept of simultaneousness but also that of duration is revealed as dependent on
the motion of the observer.]<sup><a href="#au24">24</a></sup> [Demonstration of this should be superfluous; it ought to be plain without argument
that if two observers cannot agree whether two instants are <span class="pagenum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>the same instant or not, they cannot agree on the interval of time between instants.
In the very example which we have already examined, one observer says that a certain
time-interval is zero, and another gives it a value different from zero. The same
thing happens whenever the observers are in relative motion.]* [Two physicists who
measure the duration of a physical process will not obtain the same result if they
are in relative motion with regard to one another.
</p>
<p>They will also find different results for the length of a body. An observer who wants
to measure the length of a body which is moving past him must in one way or another
hold a measuring rod parallel to its motion and mark those points on his rod with
which the ends of the body come into <i>simultaneous coincidence</i>. The distance between the two marks will then indicate the length of the body. But
if the two markings are simultaneous for one observer, they will not be so for another
one who moves with a different velocity, or who is at rest, with regard to the body
under observation. He will have to ascribe a different length to it. And there will
be no sense in asking which of them is right: length is a purely relative concept,
just as well as duration.]<sup><a href="#au24">24</a></sup>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[The degree to which distance and time become relative instead of absolute quantities
under the Special Theory of Relativity can be stated very definitely. In the first
place, we must point out <span class="pagenum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>that the relativity of lengths applies with full force only to lengths that lie parallel
to the direction of relative motion. Those that lie exactly perpendicular to that
direction come out the same for both observers; those that lie obliquely to it show
an effect, depending upon the angle, which of course becomes greater and greater as
the direction of parallelism is approached.
</p>
<p>The magnitude of the effect is easily demonstrated, but with this demonstration we
do not need to be concerned here. It turns out that if an observer moving with a system
finds that a certain time interval in the system is <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>T</i></span> seconds and that a certain length in the system is <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>L</i></span> inches, then an observer moving parallel with <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>L</i></span> and with a velocity <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span> relative to the system will find for these the respective values <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f107.5.svg" alt="upper T division-sign upper K" title="upper T division-sign upper K" class="f107.5frml"></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f107.6.svg" alt="upper L times upper K" title="upper L times upper K" class="f107.6frml"></span>, where
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f107.7.svg" alt="upper K equals StartRoot 1 minus v squared slash upper C squared EndRoot period" title="upper K equals StartRoot 1 minus v squared slash upper C squared EndRoot period" class="f107.7frml"></span>
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> in this expression of course represents the velocity of light. It will be noted that
the fraction <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f107.9.svg" alt="v squared slash upper C squared" title="v squared slash upper C squared" class="f107.9frml"></span> is ordinarily very small; that the expression under the radical is therefore less
than 1 but by a very slight margin; and that the entire expression <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span> is itself therefore less than 1 but by an even slighter margin. This means, then,
that the observer outside the system finds the lengths in the system to be a wee bit
shorter and the time intervals a wee bit longer than does the observer in the system.
Another way of putting the matter is based, ultimately, upon the fact that in order
for the observer <i>in the system</i> to get the larger value for distance and the smaller <span class="pagenum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>value for time, his measuring rod must go into the distance under measurement more
times than that of the moving observer, while his clock must beat a longer second
in order that less of them shall be recorded in a given interval between two events.
So it is often said that the measuring rod as observed from without is contracted
and the clock runs slow. This does not impress me as a happy statement, either in
form or in content.]*
</p>
<p>[The argument that these formulae are contradicted by human experience can be refuted
by examining a concrete instance. If a train is 1,000 feet long at rest, how long
will it be when running a mile a minute?]<sup><a href="#au232">232</a></sup> [I have quoted this question exactly as it appears in the essay from which it is
taken, because it is such a capital example of the objectionable way in which this
business is customarily put. For the statement that lengths decrease and time-intervals
increase &#x201c;with velocity&#x201d; is not true in just this form. The velocity, to have meaning,
must be relative to some external system; and it is the observations <i>from that external system</i> that are affected. So long as we confine ourselves to the system in which the alleged
modifications of size are stated as having taken place, there is nothing to observe
that is any different from what is usual; there is no way to establish that we are
enjoying a velocity, and in fact within the intent of the relativity theory we are
<i>not</i> enjoying a velocity, for we are moving with the objects which we are observing. It
is inter-systemic observations, and these alone, that show the effect. When we travel
with the system under observation, we get the same results as any <span class="pagenum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>other observer on this system; when we do not so travel, we must conduct our observations
from our own system, in relative motion to the other, and refer our results to our
system.
</p>
<p>Now when no particular observer is specified, we must of course assume an observer
connected with the train, or with whatever the body mentioned. To that observer it
doesn&#x2019;t make the slightest difference what the train does; it may stand at rest with
respect to some external system or it may move at any velocity whatsoever; its length
remains always 1,000 feet. In order for this question to have the significance which
its propounder means it to have, I must restate it as follows: A train is 1,000 feet
long as measured by an observer travelling with it. If it passes a second observer
at 60 miles per hour, what is its length as observed by him? The answer is now easy.]*

</p>
<p>[The word physical is used in two senses in the above paragraph. It is denied that
the observed variability in lengths indicates any &#x201c;physical&#x201d; contraction or shrinkage;
and on the heels of this it is asserted that this observed variability is of itself
an actual &#x201c;physical&#x201d; event. It is difficult to express in words the distinction between
the two senses in which the term physical is employed in these two statements, but
I think this distinction ought to be clear once its existence is emphasized. There
is no material contraction; it is not right to say that objects in motion contract
or are shorter; they are not shorter to an observer in motion with them. The whole
thing is a phenomenon of observation. The definitions which we are obliged to lay
down and the assumptions which we are obliged to make in order, first, that we shall
be able to measure at all, and second, that we shall be able to escape the <span class="corr" id="xd29e2479" title="Source: inadmissable">inadmissible</span> concept of absolute motion, are such that certain realities which we had supposed
ought to be the same for all observers turn out not to be the same for observers who
are in relative motion with respect to <i>one another</i>. We have found this out, and we have found out the numerical relation which holds
between the reality of the one observer and that of the other. We have found that
this relation depends upon nothing save the relative velocity of the two observers.
As good a way of emphasizing this as any is to point out that two observers who have
the same velocity with respect to the system under examination (and whose mutual relative
velocity is therefore zero) will always get <span class="pagenum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>the same results when measuring lengths and times on that system. The object does
not go through any process of contraction; it is simply shorter because it is observed
from a station with respect to which it is moving. Similar remarks might be made about
the time effect; but the time-interval is not so easily visualized as a concrete thing
and hence does not offer such temptation for loose statement.
</p>
<p>The purely relative aspect of the matter is further brought out if we consider a single
example both backwards and forwards. Systems <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span> are in relative motion. An object in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> which to an observer in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> is <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>L</i></span> units long, is shorter for an observer in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span>&#x2014;shorter by an amount indicated through the &#x201c;correction factor&#x201d; <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>. Now if we have, in the first instance, made the objectionable statement that objects
are shorter in system <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span> than they are in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span>, it will be quite natural for us to infer from this that objects in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> must be longer than those in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span>; and from this to assert that when the observer in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> measures objects lying in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span>, he gets for them greater lengths than does the home observer in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span>. But if we have, in the first instance, avoided the objectionable statement referred
to, we shall be much better able to realize that the whole business is quite reciprocal;
that the phenomena are symmetric with respect to the two systems, to the extent that
we can interchange the systems in any of our statements without modifying the statements
in any other way.
</p>
<p>Objects in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> appear shorter and times in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> appear longer to the external &#x201c;moving&#x201d; observer in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span> than they do to the domestic observer in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span>. Exactly in the same way, objects in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span> appear shorter to observers <span class="pagenum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>in the foreign system <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> than to the home observer in <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span>, who remains at rest with respect to them. I think that when we get the right angle
upon this situation, it loses the alleged startling character which has been imposed
upon it by many writers. The &#x201c;apparent size&#x201d; of the astronomer is an analogy in point.
Objects on the moon, by virtue of their great distance, look smaller to observers
on the earth than to observers on the moon. Do objects on the earth, on this account,
look larger to a moon observer than they do to us? They do not; any suggestion that
they do we should receive with appropriate scorn. The variation in size introduced
by distance is reciprocal, and this reciprocity does not in the least puzzle us. Why,
then, should that introduced by relative motion puzzle us?

<p class="first">Our old, accustomed concepts of time and space, which have grown up through countless
generations of our ancestors, and been handed down to us in the form in which we are
familiar with them, leave no room for a condition where time intervals and space intervals
are not universally fixed and invariant. They leave no room for us to say that]* [one
cannot know the time until he knows where he is, nor where he is until he knows the
time,]<sup><a href="#au220">220</a></sup> [nor either time or place until he knows something about velocity. But in this concise
formulation of the difference between what we have always believed and what we have
seen to be among the consequences of Einstein&#x2019;s postulates of the universal <span class="pagenum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>relativity of uniform motion, we may at once locate the assumption which, underlying
all the old ideas, is the root of all the trouble. The fact is we have always supposed
time and space to be absolutely distinct and independent entities.]*
</p>
<p>[The concept of time has ever been one of the most absolute of all the categories.
It is true that there is much of the mysterious about time; and philosophers have
spent much effort trying to clear up the mystery&#x2014;with unsatisfactory results. However,
to most persons it has seemed possible to adopt an arbitrary measure or unit of duration
and to say that this is absolute, independent of the state of the body or bodies on
which it is used for practical purposes.]<sup><a href="#au272">272</a></sup> [Time has thus been regarded as something which of itself flows on regularly and
continuously, regardless of physical events concerning matter.]<sup><a href="#au150">150</a></sup> [In other words, according to this view, time is not affected by conditions or motions
in space.]<sup><a href="#au272">272</a></sup> [We have deliberately chosen to ignore the obvious fact that time can never appear
to us, be measured by us, or have the least significance for us, save as a measure
of something that is closely tied up with space and with material space-dimensions.
Not merely have we supposed that time and space are separated in nature as in our
easiest perceptions, but we have supposed that they are of such fundamentally distinct
character that they can never be tied up together. In no way whatever, assumes the
Euclidean and Newtonian intellect, may space ever depend upon time or time upon space.
This is the assumption which we must remove in order to attain universal relativity;
and while it may come <span class="pagenum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>hard, it will not come so hard as the alternative. For this alternative is nothing
other than to abandon universal relativity. This course would leave us with logical
contradictions and discrepancies that could not be resolved by any revision of fundamental
concepts or by any cleaning out of the Augean stables of old assumptions; whereas
the relativity doctrine as built up by Einstein requires only such a cleaning out
in order to leave us with a strictly logical and consistent whole. The rôle of Hercules
is a very difficult one for us to play. Einstein has played it for the race at large,
but each of us must follow him in playing it for himself.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Some Further Consequences</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I need not trespass upon the subject matter of those essays which appear in full by
going here into any details with regard to the manner in which time and space are
finally found to depend upon one another and to form the parts of a single universal
whole. But I may appropriately point out that if time and space are found to be relative,
we may surely expect some of the less fundamental concepts that depend upon them to
be relative also. In this expectation we are not disappointed. For one thing,]* [mass
has always been assumed to be a constant, independent of any motion or energy which
it might possess. Just as lengths and times depend upon relative motion, however,
it is found that mass, which is the remaining factor in the expression for energy
due to motion, also depends upon relative velocities. The dependence is such that
if a body <span class="pagenum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>takes up an amount of energy <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>E</i></span> <i>with respect to a certain system</i>, the body behaves, to measurements made <i>from that system</i>, as though its mass had been increased by an amount <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f116.2.svg" alt="upper E slash upper C squared" title="upper E slash upper C squared" class="f116.2frml"></span>, where <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> is as usual the velocity of light.]<sup><a href="#au194">194</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[This should not startle us. The key to the situation lies in the italicized words
above, which indicate that the answer to the query whether a body has taken up energy
or not depends upon the seat of observation. If I take up my location on the system
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span>, and you on the system <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S&#x2032;</i></span>, and if we find that we are in relative motion, we must make some assumption about
the energy which was necessary, initially, to get us into this condition. Suppose
we are on two passing trains.]* [The chances are that either of us will assume that
he is at rest and that it is the other train which moves, although if sufficiently
sophisticated one of us may assume that he is moving and that the other train is at
rest.]<sup><a href="#au272">272</a></sup> [Whatever our assumption, whatever the system, the localization of the energy that
is carried in latent form by our systems depends upon this assumption. Indeed, if
our systems are of differing mass, our assumptions will even govern our ideas of the
<i>amount</i> of energy which is represented by our relative motion; if your system be the more
massive, more energy would have to be localized in it than in mine to produce our
relative motion. If we did not have the universal principle of relativity to forbid,
we might make an arbitrary assumption about our motions and hence about our respective
latent energies; in the presence of this veto, the only chance of adjustment lies
in our masses, which must differ according to whether <span class="pagenum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>you or I observe them.]*
</p>
<p>[For most of the velocities with which we are familiar <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f116.2.svg" alt="upper E slash upper C squared" title="upper E slash upper C squared" class="f116.2frml"></span> is, like the difference between <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span> and unity, such an extremely small quantity that the most delicate measurements fail
to detect it. But the electrons in a highly evacuated tube and the particles shot
out from radioactive materials attain in some cases velocities as high as eight-tenths
that of light. When we measure the mass of such particles at different velocities
we find that it actually increases with the velocity, and in accordance with the foregoing
law.]<sup><a href="#au194">194</a></sup> [This observation, in fact, antedates Einstein&#x2019;s explanation, which is far more satisfactory
than the earlier differentiation between &#x201c;normal mass&#x201d; and &#x201c;electrical mass&#x201d; which
was called upon to account for the increase.]*
</p>
<p>[But if the quantity <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f116.2.svg" alt="upper E slash upper C squared" title="upper E slash upper C squared" class="f116.2frml"></span> is to be considered as an actual increase in mass, may it not be possible that all
mass is energy? This would lead to the conclusion that the energy stored up in <i>any</i> mass is <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f117.4.svg" alt="m upper C squared" title="m upper C squared" class="f117.4frml"></span>. The value is very great, since <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> is so large; but it is in good agreement with the internal energy of the atom as
calculated from other considerations. It is obvious that conservation of mass and
of momentum cannot both hold good under a theory that translates the one into the
other. Mass is then not considered by Einstein as conservative in the ordinary sense,
but it is the total quantity of mass plus energy in any closed system that remains
constant. Small amounts of energy may be transformed into mass, and <i>vice versa</i>.]<sup><a href="#au194">194</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[Other features of the theory which are often displayed as consequences are really
more in the <span class="pagenum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>nature of assumptions. It will be recalled that when we had agreed upon the necessity
of employing signals of some sort, we selected as the means of signalling the speediest
messenger with which we happened to be acquainted. Our subsequent difficulties were
largely due to the impossibility of making a proper allowance for this messenger&#x2019;s
speed, even though we knew its numerical value; and as a consequence, this speed enters
into our formulae. Now we have not said in so many words that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> is the greatest speed attainable, but we have tacitly assumed that it is. We need
not, therefore, be surprised if our formulae give us absurd results for speeds higher
than <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>, and indicate the impossibility of ever attaining these. Whatever we put into a problem
the algebra is bound to give us back. If we look at our formula for <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>, we see that in the event of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span> equalling <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>, lengths become zero and times infinite. The light messenger itself, then, has no
dimension; and for it time stands still.
</p>
<p>If we suppose <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span> to be greater than <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>, we get even more bizarre results, for then the factor <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span> is the square root of a negative number, or as the mathematician calls it an &#x201c;imaginary&#x201d;
quantity; and with it, lengths and times become imaginary too.
</p>
<p>The fact that time stops for it, and the fact that it is the limiting velocity, give
to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> certain of the attributes of the mathematician&#x2019;s infinity. Certainly if it can never
be exceeded, we must have a new formula for the composition of velocities. Otherwise
when my system passes yours at a speed of 100,000 miles per second, while yours passes
a third in the same direction at the same velocity, I shall be <span class="pagenum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>passing this third framework at the forbidden velocity of 200,000 miles per second&#x2014;greater
than <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>. In fact Einstein is able to show that an old formula, which had already been found
to connect the speed of light in a <i>material</i> medium with the speed of that medium, will now serve universally for the composition
of velocities. When we combine the velocities <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>u</i></span>, instead of getting the resultant <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f119.4.svg" alt="v plus u" title="v plus u" class="f119.4frml"></span> as we would have supposed, we get the resultant
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f119.5.svg" alt="left-parenthesis v plus u right-parenthesis slash left-parenthesis 1 plus left-parenthesis u v slash upper C squared right-parenthesis right-parenthesis comma" title="left-parenthesis v plus u right-parenthesis slash left-parenthesis 1 plus left-parenthesis u v slash upper C squared right-parenthesis right-parenthesis comma" class="f119.5frml"></span> or <span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f119.6.svg" alt="upper C squared left-parenthesis v plus u right-parenthesis slash left-parenthesis upper C squared plus u v right-parenthesis" title="upper C squared left-parenthesis v plus u right-parenthesis slash left-parenthesis upper C squared plus u v right-parenthesis" class="f119.6frml"></span>
</p>
<p>This need not surprise us either, if we will but reflect that the second velocity
effects a second revision of length and time measurements between the systems involved.
And now, if we let either <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span>, or <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>u</i></span>, or even both of them, take the value <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>, the resultant still is <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>. In another way we have found <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> to behave like the mathematician&#x2019;s infinity, to which, in the words of the blind
poet, if we add untold thousands, we effect no real increment.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Assumption and Consequence</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A good many correspondents who have given the subject sufficient thought to realize
that the limiting character of the velocity <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> is really read into Einstein&#x2019;s system by assumption have written, in more or less
perturbed inquiry, to know whether this does not invalidate the whole structure. The
answer, of course, is yes&#x2014;provided you can show this assumption <span class="pagenum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>to be invalid. The same answer may be made of any scientific doctrine whatever, and
in reference to any one of the multitudinous assumptions underlying it. If we were
to discover, tomorrow, a way of sending signals absolutely instantaneously, Einstein&#x2019;s
whole structure would collapse as soon as we had agreed to use this new method. If
we were to discover a signalling agent with finite velocity greater than that of light,
relativity would persist with this velocity written in its formulae in the place of
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>.
</p>
<p>It is a mistake to quote Einstein&#x2019;s theory in support of the statement that such a
velocity can never be. An assumption proves its consequences, but never can prove
itself; it must remain always an assumption. But in the presence of long human experience
supporting Einstein&#x2019;s assumption that no velocity in excess of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> can be found, it is fair to demand that it be disputed not with argument but with
demonstration. The one line of argument that would hold out <i>a priori</i> hope of reducing the assumption to an absurdity would be one based on the familiar
idea of adding velocities; but Einstein has spiked this argument before it is started
by replacing the direct addition of velocities with another method of combining them
that fits in with his assumption and as well with the observed facts. The burden of
proof is then on the prosecution; anyone who would contradict our assertion that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> is the greatest velocity attainable may do so only by showing us a greater one. Until
this has been done, the admission that it may properly be attempted can in no way
be construed as a confession of weakness on the part of Einstein.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>It may be well to point out that in no event may analogy be drawn with sound, as many
have tried to do. In the first place sound requires a material medium and its velocity
with regard to <i>this</i> rather than relative to the observer we know to be fixed; in the second place, requiring
a material medium, sound is not a universal signalling agent; in the third place,
we <i>know</i> definitely that its velocity <i>can</i> be exceeded, and are therefore barred from making the assumption necessary to establish
the analogy. The very extraordinary behavior of light in presenting a velocity that
<i>is</i> the same for all observers, and in refusing to betray the least material evidence
of any medium for its transmission, rather fortifies us in believing that Einstein&#x2019;s
assumption regarding the ultimate character of this velocity is in accord with the
nature of things.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A great deal can be said in the direction of general comment making the Special Theory
and its surprising accompaniments easier of acceptance, and we shall conclude the
present discussion by saying some of these things.]* [It has been objected that the
various effects catalogued above are only apparent, due to the finite velocity of
light&#x2014;that the <i>real</i> shape and size of a body or the <i>real</i> time of an event cannot be affected by the point of view or the motion of an observer.
This argument would be perfectly valid, if there <i>were</i> real times and distances; but there are not. These are earth-bound notions, due to
our experience on an apparently motionless platform, <span class="pagenum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>with slow-moving bodies. Under these circumstances different observations of the same
thing or of the same event agree. But when we no longer have the solid earth to stand
on, and are dealing with velocities so high that the relativity effects become appreciable,
there is no standard by which to resolve the disagreements. No one of the observations
can claim to be nearer reality than any other. To demand the real size of a thing
is to demand a stationary observer or an instantaneous means of information. Both
are impossible.
</p>
<p>When relativity asks us to give up our earth-bound notions of absolute space and absolute
time the sensation, at first, is that we have nothing left to stand on. So must the
contemporaries of Columbus have felt when told that the earth rested on&#x2014;nothing. The
remedy too is similar. Just as they had to be taught that falling is a local affair,
that the earth is self-contained, and needs no external support&#x2014;so we must be taught
that space and time standards are local affairs. Each moving body carries its own
space and time standards with it; it is self-contained. It does not need to reach
out for eternal support, for an absolute space and time that can never quite be attained.
All we ever need to know is the relation of the other fellow&#x2019;s space and time standards
to our own. This is the first thing relativity teaches us.]<sup><a href="#au141">141</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[The consequences of Einstein&#x2019;s assumptions have led many to reject the theory of
relativity, on the ground that its conclusions are contrary to common sense&#x2014;as they
undoubtedly are. But to the contemporaries of Copernicus and Galileo the theory that
<span class="pagenum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>the earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the sun was contrary to common sense;
yet this theory prevailed. There is nothing sacred about common sense; in the last
analysis its judgments are based on the accumulated experience of the human race.
From the beginning of the world up to the present generation, no bodies were known
whose velocities were not extremely small compared with that of light. The development
of modern physics has led to discovery of very much larger velocities, some as high
as 165,000 miles per second. It is not to be wondered at that such an enlargement
of our experience requires a corresponding enlargement or generalization of the concepts
of space and time. Just as the presupposition of primitive man that the earth was
flat had to be given up in the light of advancing knowledge, so we are now called
upon to give up our presupposition that space and time are absolute and independent
in their nature.
</p>
<p>The reader must not expect to understand the theory of relativity in the sense of

we are unfamiliar with the idea that some of our habitual notions may be wrong; but

may now be ready to grant that the earth, seemingly so solid, is really a whirling

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The science of geometry has undergone a revolution of which the outsider is not informed,
but which it is necessary to understand if we are to attain any comprehension of the
geometric formulation of Einstein&#x2019;s results; and especially if we are to appreciate
why it is proper and desirable to formulate these results geometrically at all. The
classical geometer regarded his science from a narrow viewpoint, as the study of a
certain set of observed phenomena&#x2014;those of the space about us, considered as an entity
in itself and divorced from everything in it. It is clear that some things about that
space are not as they appear (optical illusions), and that other things about it are
true but by no means apparent (the sum-of-squares property of a right triangle, the
formulæ for surface and volume of a sphere, etc.). While many things about space <i>are</i> &#x201c;obvious,&#x201d; these need in the one case disproof and in the other discovery and proof.
With all their love of mental processes for their own sake, it is <span class="pagenum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>then not surprising that the Greeks should have set themselves the task of proving
by logical process the properties of space, which a less thoughtful folk would have
regarded as a subject only for observational and experimental determination.
</p>
<p>But, abstract or concrete, the logical structure must have a starting point; and it
is fair to demand that this consist in a statement of the terms we are going to use
and the meanings we are going to attach to them. In other words, the first thing on
the program will be a definition, or more probably, several definitions.
</p>
<p>Now the modern scientist has a somewhat iconoclastic viewpoint toward definitions,
and especially toward the definition of his very most fundamental ideas.
</p>
<p>We do not speak here in terms of dictionary definitions. These have for object the
eminent necessity of explaining the meaning and use of a word to some one who has
just met it for the first time. It is easy enough to do this, if the doer possesses
a good command of the language. It is not even a matter of grave concern that the
words used in the definition be themselves known to the reader; if they are not, he
must make their acquaintance too. Dr. Johnson&#x2019;s celebrated definition of a needle
stands as perpetual evidence that when he cannot define a simple thing in terms of
things still simpler, the lexicographer is forced to define it in terms of things
more complex. Or we might demonstrate this by noting that the best dictionaries are
driven to define such words as &#x201c;and&#x201d; and &#x201c;but&#x201d; by using such complex <span class="pagenum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>notions as are embodied in &#x201c;connective,&#x201d; &#x201c;continuative,&#x201d; &#x201c;adversative,&#x201d; and &#x201c;particle.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>It is otherwise with the scientist who undertakes to lay down a definition as the
basis of further procedure in building up the tissue of his science. Here a degree
of rigorous logic is called for which would be as superfluous in the dictionary as
the effort there to attain it would be out of place. The scientist, in building up
a logical structure that will withstand every assault, must define everything, not
in terms of something which he is more or less warranted in supposing his audience
to know about, but actually in terms of things that have already been defined. This
really means that he must explain what he is talking about in terms of simpler ideas
and simpler things, which is precisely what the lexicographer does not have to worry
about. This is why it is quite trivial to quote a dictionary definition of time or
space or matter or force or motion in settlement of a controversy of scientific or
semi-scientific nature.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Terms We Cannot Define</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But the scientist who attempts to carry out this ideal system of defining everything
in terms of what precedes meets one obstacle which he cannot surmount directly. Even
a layman can construct a passable definition of a complex thing like a parallelopiped,
in terms of simpler concepts like point, line, plane and parallel. But who shall define
point in terms of something simpler and something which precedes point in the formulation
of geometry? The scientist is embarrassed, not in handling the complicated later parts
of his work, but in the very beginning, <span class="pagenum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>in dealing with the simplest concepts with which he has to deal.
</p>
<p>Suppose a dictionary were to be compiled with the definitions arranged in logical
rather than alphabetical order: every word to be defined by the use only of words
that have already been defined. The further back toward the beginning we push this
project, the harder it gets. Obviously we can never define the first word, or the
second, save as <span class="corr" id="xd29e2877" title="Source: synonomous">synonymous</span> with the first. In fact we should need a dozen words, more or less, to start with&#x2014;God-given
words which we cannot define and shall not try to define, but of which we must <i>agree that we know</i> the significance. Then we have tools for further procedure; we can start with, say,
the thirteenth word and define all the rest of the words in the language, in strictly
logical fashion.
</p>
<p>What we have said about definitions applies equally to statements of fact, of the
sort which are going to constitute the body of our science. In the absence of simpler
facts to cite as authority, we shall never be able to prove anything, however simple
this may itself be; and in fact the simpler it be, the harder it is to find something
simpler to underlie it. If we are to have a logical structure of any sort, we must
begin by laying down certain terms which we shall not attempt to define, and certain
statements which we shall not try to prove. Mathematics, physics, chemistry&#x2014;in the
large and in all their many minor fields&#x2014;all these must start somewhere. Instead of
deceiving ourselves as to the circumstances surrounding their start, we prefer to
be quite frank in recognizing that they start where we decide <span class="pagenum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>to start them. If we don&#x2019;t like one set of undefined terms as the foundation, by all
means let us try another. But always we must have such a set.
</p>
<p>The classical geometer sensed the difficulty of defining his first terms. But he supposed
that he had met it when he defined these in words free of technical significance.
&#x201c;A point is that which has position without size&#x201d; seemed to him an adequate definition,
because &#x201c;position&#x201d; and &#x201c;size&#x201d; are words of the ordinary language with which we may
all be assumed familiar. But today we feel that &#x201c;position&#x201d; and &#x201c;size&#x201d; represent ideas
that are not necessarily more fundamental than those of &#x201c;line&#x201d; and &#x201c;point,&#x201d; and that
such a definition begs the question. We get nowhere by replacing the undefined terms
&#x201c;point&#x201d; and &#x201c;line&#x201d; and &#x201c;plane,&#x201d; which really everybody understands, by other undefined
terms which nobody understands any better.
</p>
<p>In handling the facts that it was inconvenient to prove, the classical geometer came
closer to modern practice. He laid down at the beginning a few statements which he
called &#x201c;axioms,&#x201d; and which he considered to be so self-evident that demonstration
was superfluous. That the term &#x201c;self-evident&#x201d; left room for a vast amount of ambiguity
appears to have escaped him altogether. His axioms were axioms solely because they
were obviously true.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Laying the Foundation</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The modern geometer falls in with Euclid when he writes an elementary text, satisfying
the beginner&#x2019;s demand for apparent rigor by defining point <span class="pagenum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>and line in some fashion. But when he addresses to his peers an effort to clarify
the foundations of geometry to a further degree of rigor and lucidity than has ever
before been attained, he meets these difficulties from another quarter. In the first
place he is always in search of the utmost possible generality, for he has found this
to be his most effective tool, enabling him as it does to make a single general statement
take the place and do the work of many particular statements. The classical geometer
attained generality of a sort, for all his statements were of <i>any</i> point or line or plane. But the modern geometer, confronted with a relation that
holds among points or between points and lines, at once goes to speculating whether
there are not other elements among or between which it holds. The classical geometer
isn&#x2019;t interested in this question at all, because he is seeking the absolute truth
about the points and lines and planes which he sees as the elements of space; to him
it is actually an object so to circumscribe his statements that they may by no possibility
refer to anything other than these elements. Whereas the modern geometer feels that
his primary concern is with the fabric of logical propositions that he is building
up, and not at all with the elements about which those propositions revolve.
</p>
<p>It is of obvious value if the mathematician can lay down a proposition true of points,
lines and planes. But he would much rather lay down a proposition true at once of
these and of numerous other things; for such a proposition will group more phenomena
under a single principle. He feels that on pure <span class="pagenum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>scientific grounds there is quite as much interest in any one set of elements to which
his proposition applies as there is in any other; that if any person is to confine
his attention to the set that stands for the physicist&#x2019;s space, that person ought
to be the physicist, not the geometer. If he has produced a tool which the physicist
can use, the physicist is welcome to use it; but the geometer cannot understand why,
on that ground, he should be asked to confine <i>his</i> attention to the materials on which the physicist employs that tool.
</p>
<p>It will be alleged that points and lines and planes lie in the mathematician&#x2019;s domain,
and that the other things to which his propositions may apply may not so lie&#x2014;and especially
that if he will not name them in advance he cannot expect that they will so lie. But
the mathematician will not admit this. If mathematics is defined on narrow grounds
as the science of number, even the point and line and plane may be excluded from its
field. If any wider definition be sought&#x2014;and of course one must be&#x2014;there is just one
definition that the mathematician will accept: Dr. Keyser&#x2019;s statement that &#x201c;mathematics
is the art or science of rigorous thinking.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The immediate concern of this science is the means of rigorous thinking&#x2014;undefined
terms and definitions, axioms and propositions. Its collateral concern is the things
to which these may apply, the things which may be thought about rigorously&#x2014;everything.
But now the mathematician&#x2019;s domain is so vastly extended that it becomes more than
ever important for him to attain the utmost generality in all his pronouncements.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>One barrier to such generalization is the very name &#x201c;geometry,&#x201d; with the restricted
significance which its derivation and long usage carry. The geometer therefore must
have it distinctly understood that for him &#x201c;geometry&#x201d; means simply the process of
deducing a set of propositions from a set of undefined primitive terms and axioms;
and that when he speaks of &#x201c;a geometry&#x201d; he means some particular set of propositions
so deduced, together with the axioms, etc., on which they are based. If you take a
new set of axioms you get a new geometry.
</p>
<p>The geometer will, if you insist, go on calling his undefined terms by the familiar
names &#x201c;point,&#x201d; &#x201c;line,&#x201d; &#x201c;plane.&#x201d; But you must distinctly understand that this is a
concession to usage, and that you are not for a moment to restrict the application
of his statements in any way. He would much prefer, however, to be allowed new names
for his elements, to say &#x201c;We start with three elements of different sorts, which we
assume to exist, and to which we attach the names A, B and C&#x2014;or if you prefer, primary,
secondary and tertiary elements&#x2014;or yet again, names possessing no intrinsic significance
at all, such as ching, chang and chung.&#x201d; He will then lay down whatever statements
he requires to serve the purposes of the ancient axioms, all of these referring to
some one or more of his elements. Then he is ready for the serious business of proving
that, <i>all his hypotheses being granted</i>, his elements A, B and C, or I, II and III, or ching, chang and chung, are subject
to this and that and the other propositions.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>The objection will be urged that the mathematician who does all this usurps the place
of the logician. A little reflection will show this not to be the case. The logician
in fact occupies the same position with reference to the geometer that the geometer
occupies with reference to the physicist, the chemist, the arithmetician, the engineer,
or anybody else whose primary interest lies with some particular set of elements to
which the geometer&#x2019;s system applies. The mathematician is the tool-maker of all science,
but he does not make his own tools&#x2014;these the logician supplies. The logician in turn
never descends to the actual practice of rigorous thinking, save as he must necessarily
do this in laying down the general procedures which govern rigorous thinking. He is
interested in processes, not in their application. He tells us that if a proposition
is true its converse may be true or false or ambiguous, but its contrapositive is
always true, while its negative is always false. But he never, from a particular proposition
&#x201c;If A is B then C is D,&#x201d; draws the particular contrapositive inference &#x201c;If C is not
D then A is not B.&#x201d; That is the mathematician&#x2019;s business.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Rôle of Geometry</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The mathematician is the quantity-production man of science. In his absence, the worker
in each narrower field where the elements under discussion take particular concrete
forms could work out, for himself, the propositions of the logical structure that
applies to those elements. But it would then be found that the engineer had duplicated
the work of the physicist, and so for many other cases; for the <span class="pagenum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>whole trend of modern science is toward showing that the same background of principles
lies at the root of all things. So the mathematician develops the fabric of propositions
that follows from this, that and the other group of assumptions, and does this without
in the least concerning himself as to the nature of the elements of which these propositions
may be true. He knows only that they are true for any elements of which his assumptions
are true, and that is all he needs to know. Whenever the worker in some particular
field finds that a certain group of the geometer&#x2019;s assumptions <i>is</i> true for his elements, the geometry of those elements is ready at hand for him to
use.
</p>
<p>Now it is all right purposely to avoid knowing what it is that we are talking about,
so that the names of these things shall constitute mere blank forms which may be filled
in, when and if we wish, by the names of any things in the universe of which our &#x201c;axioms&#x201d;
turn out to be true. But what about these axioms themselves? When we lay them down
in ignorance of the identity of the elements to which they may eventually apply, they
cannot by any possibility be &#x201c;self-evident.&#x201d; We may, at pleasure, accept as self-evident
a statement about points and lines and planes; or one about electrons, centimeters
and seconds; or one about integers, fractions, and irrational numbers; or one about
any other concrete thing or things whatever. But we cannot accept as self-evident
a statement about chings, changs and chungs. So we must base our &#x201c;axioms&#x201d; on some
other ground than this; and our modern geometer has his ground ready and waiting.
He accepts his <span class="pagenum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>axioms on the ground that it pleases him to do so. To avoid all suggestion that they
are supposed to be self-evident, or even necessarily true, he drops the term &#x201c;axiom&#x201d;
and substitutes for it the more color-less word &#x201c;postulate.&#x201d; A postulate is merely
something that we agreed to accept, for the time being, as a basis of further argument.
If it turns out to be true, or if we can find circumstances under which and elements
to which it applies, any conclusions which we deduce from it by trustworthy processes
are valid within the same limitations. And the propositions which tell us that, <i>if</i> our postulates are true, such and such conclusions are true&#x2014;they, too, are valid,
but without any reservation at all!
</p>
<p>Perhaps an illustration of just what this means will not be out of place. Let it be
admitted, as a postulate, that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f136.1.svg" alt="7 plus 20" title="7 plus 20" class="f136.1frml"></span> is greater, by 1, than <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f136.2.svg" alt="7 plus 19" title="7 plus 19" class="f136.2frml"></span>. Let us then consider the statement: &#x201c;If <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f136.3.svg" alt="7 plus 19 equals 65" title="7 plus 19 equals 65" class="f136.3frml"></span>, then <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f136.4.svg" alt="7 plus 20 equals 66" title="7 plus 20 equals 66" class="f136.4frml"></span>.&#x201d; We know&#x2014;at least we are quite certain&#x2014;that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f136.5.svg" alt="7 plus 19" title="7 plus 19" class="f136.5frml"></span> is not equal to 65, if by &#x201c;7&#x201d; and &#x201c;19&#x201d; and &#x201c;65&#x201d; we mean what you think we mean. We
are equally sure, on the same grounds, that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f136.6.svg" alt="7 plus 20" title="7 plus 20" class="f136.6frml"></span> is not equal to 66. But, under the one assumption that we have permitted ourselves,
it is unquestionable that <i>if</i> <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f136.5.svg" alt="7 plus 19" title="7 plus 19" class="f136.5frml"></span> <i>were</i> equal to 65, then <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f136.6.svg" alt="7 plus 20" title="7 plus 20" class="f136.6frml"></span> certainly <i>would be</i> equal to 66. So, while the conclusion of the proposition which I have put in quotation
marks is altogether false, the proposition itself, under our assumption, is entirely
true. I have taken an illustration designed to be striking rather than to possess
scientific interest; I could just as easily have shown a true proposition leading
to a false conclusion, but of <span class="pagenum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>such sort that it would be of decided scientific interest as telling us one of the
consequences of a certain assumption.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">What May We Take for Granted?</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is all very fine; but how does the geometer know what postulates to lay down?
One is tempted to say that he is at liberty to postulate anything he pleases, and
investigate the results; and that whether or not his postulate ever be realized, the
propositions that he deduces from it, being true, are of scientific interest. Actually,
however, it is not quite as simple as all that. If it were sufficient to make a single
postulate it <i>would</i> be as simple as all that; but it turns out that this is not sufficient any more than
it is sufficient to have a single undefined term. We must have several postulates;
and they must be such, as a whole, that a geometry flows out of them. The requirements
are three.
</p>
<p>In the first place, the system of postulates must be &#x201c;categorical&#x201d; or complete&#x2014;there
must be enough of them, and they must cover enough ground, for the support of a complete
system of geometry. In practice the test for this is direct. If we got to a point
in the building up of a geometry where we could not prove whether a certain thing
was one way always, or always the other way, or sometimes one way and sometimes the
other, we should conclude that we needed an additional postulate covering this ground
directly or indirectly. And we should make that postulate&#x2014;because it is precisely
the <span class="pagenum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>things that we can&#x2019;t prove which, in practical work, we agree to assume. Even Euclid
had to adopt this philosophy.
</p>
<p>In the second place, the system of postulates must be consistent&#x2014;no one or more of
them may lead, individually or collectively, to consequences that contradict the results
or any other or others. If in the course of building up a geometry we find we have
proved two propositions that deny one another, we search out the implied contradiction
in our postulates and remedy it.
</p>
<p>Finally, the postulates ought to be <span class="corr" id="xd29e2983" title="Source: indepedent">independent</span>. It should not be possible to prove any one of them as a consequence of the others.
If this property fails, the geometry does not fail with it; but it is seriously disfigured
by the superfluity of assumptions, and one of them should be eliminated. If we are
to assume <i>anything</i> unnecessarily, we may as well assume the whole geometry and be done with it.
</p>
<p>The geometer&#x2019;s business then is to draw up a set of postulates. This he may do on
any basis whatever. They may be suggested to him by the behavior of points, lines
and planes, or by some other concrete phenomena; they may with equal propriety be
the product of an inventive imagination. On proceeding to deduce their consequences,
he will discover and remedy any lack of categoricity or consistence or independence
which his original system of postulates may have lacked. In the end he will have so
large a body of propositions without contradiction or failure that he will conclude
the propriety of his postulates to have been established, and the geometry based on
them to be a valid one.

<p class="first">Is this geometry ever realized? Strictly it is not the geometer&#x2019;s business to ask
or answer this question. But research develops two viewpoints. There is always the
man who indulges in the pursuit of facts for their sake alone, and equally the man
who wants to see his new facts lead to something else. One great mathematician is
quoted as enunciating a new theory of surpassing mathematical beauty with the climacteric
remark &#x201c;And, thank God, no one will ever be able to find any use for it.&#x201d; An equally
distinguished contemporary, on being interrogated concerning possible applications
for one of his most abstruse theorems, replied that he knew no present use for it;
but that long experience had made him confident that the mathematician would never
develop any tool, however remote from immediate utility, for which the delvers in
other fields would not presently find some use.
</p>
<p>If we wish, however, we may inquire with perfect propriety, from the side lines, whether
a given geometry is ever realized. We may learn that so far as has yet been discovered
there are no elements for which all its postulates are verified, and that there is
therefore no realization known. On the other hand, we may more likely find that many
different sets of elements are such that the postulates can be interpreted as applying
to them, and that we therefore have numerous realizations of the geometry. As a human
being the geometer may be interested in all this, but as a geometer it really makes
little difference to him.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>When we look at space about us, we see it, for some reason grounded in the psychological
history of the human race, as made up in the small of points, which go to make up
lines, which in turn constitute planes. Or we can start at the other end and break
space down first into planes, then into lines, finally into points. Our perceptions
and conceptions of these points, lines and planes are very definite indeed; it seems
indeed, as the Greeks thought, that certain things about them are self-evident. If
we wish to take these self-evident properties of point, line and plane, and combine
with them enough additional hair-splitting specifications to assure the modern geometer
that we have really a categorical system of assumptions, we shall have the basis of
a perfectly good system of geometry. This will be what we unavoidably think of as
the absolute truth with regard to the space about us; but you mustn&#x2019;t say so in the
presence of the geometer. It will also be what we call the Euclidean geometry. It
has been satisfactory in the last degree, because not only space, but pretty much
every other system of two or three elements bearing any relations to one another can
be made, by employing as a means of interpretation the <span class="corr" id="xd29e3001" title="Source: Descartean">Cartesian</span> scheme of plotting, to fit into the framework of Euclidean geometry. But it is not
the only thing in the world of conceptual possibilities, and it begins to appear that
it may not even be the only thing in the world of cold hard fact that surrounds us.
To see just how this is so we must return to Euclid, and survey the historical development
of geometry from his day to the present time.

<p class="first">Point, line and plane Euclid attempts to define. Modern objection to these efforts
was made clear above. Against Euclid&#x2019;s specific performance we urge the further specific
fault that his &#x201c;definitions&#x201d; are really assumptions bestowing certain properties upon
points, lines and planes. These assumptions Euclid supplements in his axioms; and
in the process of proving <span class="corr" id="xd29e3011" title="Source: propostions">propositions</span> he unconsciously supplements them still further. This is to be expected from one
whose justification for laying down an axiom was the alleged obvious character of
the statement made. If some things are too obvious to require demonstration, others
may be admitted as too obvious to demand explicit statement at all.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p126width"><img src="images/p126.png" alt="" width="489" height="308"></div><p>
</p>
<p>Thus, if Euclid has two points A and B in a plane, on opposite sides of a line M,
he will draw the line AB and without further formality speak of the point C <i>in which it intersects</i> M. That it does so intercept M, rather than in some way dodges it, is <span class="pagenum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>really an assumption as to the nature of lines and planes. Or again, Euclid will speak
of a point D on the line AB, between or outside the points A and B, without making
the formal assumption necessary to insure that the line is &#x201c;full<span class="corr" id="xd29e3023" title="Source: &#x2019;">&#x201d;</span> of points so that such a point as D must exist. That such assumptions as these are
necessary follows from our previous remarks. If we think of our geometry as dealing
with &#x201c;chings,&#x201d; &#x201c;changs,&#x201d; and &#x201c;chungs,&#x201d; or with elements I, II and III, it is no longer
in the least degree obvious that the simplest property in the world applies to these
elements. If we wish any property to prevail we must state it explicitly.
</p>
<p>With the postulates embodied in his definitions, those stated in his axioms, and those
which he reads into his structure by his methods of proof, Euclid has a categorical
set&#x2014;enough to serve as foundation for a geometry. We may then climb into Euclid&#x2019;s
shoes and take the next step with him. We follow him while he proves a number of things
about intersecting lines and about triangles. To be sure, when he proves that two
triangles are identically constituted by moving one of them over on top of the other,
we may protest on the ground that the admission of motion, especially of motion thus
imposed from without, into a geometry of things is not beyond dispute. If Euclid has
caught our modern viewpoint, he will rejoin that if we have any doubts as to the admissibility
of motion he will lay down a postulate admitting it, and we shall be silenced.
</p>
<p>Having exhausted for the present the interest of intersecting lines, our guide now
passes to a consideration <span class="pagenum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>of lines in the same plane that never meet. He defines such lines as parallel. If
we object that he should show the existence of a derived concept like this before
laying down a definition that calls for it to exist, he can show that two lines drawn
perpendicular to the same line never meet. He will execute this proof by a special
sort of superposition, which requires that the plane be folded over on itself, through
the third dimension of surrounding space, rather than merely slid along upon itself.

<p>We remain quiet while Euclid demonstrates that if two lines are cut by <i>any</i> transversal in such a way as to make corresponding angles at the two intersections
equal, the lines are parallel. It is then in order to investigate the converse: if
the lines are parallel to begin with, are the angles equal?

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Axioms Made to Order</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This sounds innocent enough; but in no way was Euclid able to devise a proof&#x2014;or, for
that matter, a disproof. So he took the only way out, and said that if the lines were
parallel, obviously they extended in the same direction and made the angles equal.
The thing was so obvious, he argued, that <span class="pagenum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>it was really an axiom and he didn&#x2019;t have to prove it; so he stated it as an axiom
and proceeded. He didn&#x2019;t state it in precisely the form I have used; he apparently
cast about for the form in which it would appear most obvious, and found a statement
that suited him better than this one, and that comes to the same thing. This statement
tells us that if the transversal makes two corresponding angles <i>unequal</i>, the lines that it cuts are not parallel and do meet if sufficiently prolonged. But
wisely enough, he did not transplant this axiom, once he had arrived at it, to the
beginning of the book where the other axioms were grouped; he left it right where
it was, following the proposition that if the angles were equal the lines were parallel.
This of course was so that it might appeal back, for its claim to obviousness, to
its demonstrated converse of the proposition.
</p>
<p>Euclid must have been dissatisfied with this cutting of the Gordian knot; his successors
were acutely so. For twenty centuries the parallel axiom was regarded as the one blemish
in an otherwise perfect work; every respectable mathematician had his shot at removing
the defect by &#x201c;proving&#x201d; the objectionable axiom. The procedure was always the same:
expunge the parallel axiom, in its place write another more or less &#x201c;obvious&#x201d; assumption,
and from this derive the parallel statement more or less directly. Thus if we may
assume that the sum of the angles of a triangle is always exactly 180 degrees, or
that there can be drawn only one line through a given point parallel to a given line,
we can prove Euclid&#x2019;s axiom. Sometimes the substitute assumption <span class="pagenum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>was openly made and stated, as in the two instances cited; as often it was admitted
into the demonstration implicitly, as when it is quietly assumed that we can draw
a triangle similar to any given triangle and with area as great as we please, or when
parallels are &#x201c;defined&#x201d; as everywhere equidistant. But such &#x201c;proofs&#x201d; never satisfied
anyone other than the man who made them; the search went merrily on for a valid &#x201c;proof&#x201d;
that should not in substance assume the thing to be proved.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Saccheri, an Italian Jesuit, would have struck bottom if he had had a little more
imagination. He gave an exhaustive <i lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>, on the basis of the angle-sum theorem. This sum must be (a) greater than or (b)
equal to or (c) less than 180 degrees. Saccheri showed that if one of these alternatives
occurs in a single triangle, it must occur in every triangle. The first case gave
little trouble; admitting the possibility of superposing in the special manner mentioned
above, which he did implicitly, he showed that this &#x201c;obtuse-angled hypothesis&#x201d; contradicted
itself. He pursued the &#x201c;acute-angled hypothesis&#x201d; for a long time before he satisfied
himself that he had caught it, too, in an inconsistency. This left only the &#x201c;right-angled
hypothesis,&#x201d; proving the Euclidean angle-sum theory and through it the parallel postulate.
But Saccheri was wrong: he had found no actual contradiction in the acute-angled hypothesis&#x2014;for
none exists therein.
</p>
<p>The full facts were probably first known to Gauss, <span class="pagenum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>who had a finger in every mathematical pie that had to do with the transition to modern
times. They were first published by Lobatchewsky, the Russian, who anticipated the
Hungarian John Bolyai by a narrow margin. All three worked independently of Saccheri,
whose book, though theoretically available in Italian libraries, was actually lost
to sight and had to be rediscovered in recent years.
</p>
<p>Like Saccheri, Lobatchewsky investigated alternative possibilities. But he chose another
point of attack: through a given point it must be possible to draw, in the same plane
with a given line (a) no lines or (b) one line or (c) a plurality of lines, which
shall not meet the given line. The word parallel is defined only in terms of the second
of these hypotheses, so we avoid it here. These three cases correspond, respectively,
to those of Saccheri.
</p>
<p>The first case Lobatchewsky ruled out just as did Saccheri, but accepting consciously
the proviso attached to its elimination; the third he could not rule out. He developed
the consequences of this hypothesis as far as Euclid develops those of the second
one, sketching in a full outline for a system of geometry and trigonometry based on
a plurality of &#x201c;non-cutters.&#x201d; This geometry constitutes a coherent whole, without
a logical flaw.
</p>
<p>This made it plain what was the matter with Euclid&#x2019;s parallel axiom. Nobody could
prove it from his other assumptions <i>because it is not a consequence of these</i>. True or false, it is independent of them. Trinity Church is in New York, Faneuil
Hall is in Boston, but Faneuil Hall is not in Boston <i>because</i> Trinity is in New York; and we could not <span class="pagenum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>prove that Faneuil Hall was in Boston if we knew nothing about America save that Trinity
is in New York. The mathematicians of 2,000 years had been pursuing, on a gigantic
scale, a delusion of <i lang="la">post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">What the Postulate Really Does</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Moreover, in the absence of an assumption covering the ground, we shall not know which
of the alternatives (a), (b), (c) holds. But when one holds in a single case it holds
permanently, as Saccheri and Lobatchewsky both showed. So we cannot proceed on this
indefinite basis; we must know which one is to hold. Without the parallel postulate
or a substitute therefor that shall tell us the same thing or tell us something different,
we have not got a categorical set of assumptions&#x2014;we cannot build a geometry at all.
That is why Euclid had to have his parallel postulate before he could proceed. That
is why his successors had to have an assumption equivalent to his.
</p>
<p>The reason why it took so long for this to percolate into the understanding of the
mathematicians was that they were thinking, not in terms of the modern geometry and
about undefined elements; but in terms of the old geometry and about strictly defined
and circumscribed elements. If we understand what is meant by Euclidean line and plane,
of course the parallel postulate, to use the old geometer&#x2019;s word, is true&#x2014;of course,
to adopt the modern viewpoint, if we agree to employ an element to which that assumption
applies, the assumption is <span class="pagenum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>realized. The very fact of accepting the &#x201c;straight&#x201d; line and the &#x201c;flat&#x201d; plane of Euclid
constitutes acceptance of his parallel postulate&#x2014;the only thing that can separate
his geometry from other geometries. But of course we can&#x2019;t prove it; the prior postulates
which we would have to use in such an attempt apply where it does not apply, and hence
it cannot possibly be consequences of.
</p>
<p>To all this the classical Euclidean rejoins that we seem to have in mind elements
of some sort to which, with one reservation, his postulates apply. He wants to know
what these elements look like. We can, and must, produce them&#x2014;else our talk about
generality is mere drivel. But we must take care that the Euclidean geometer does
not try to apply to our elements the notions of straightness and flatness which inhere
in the parallel postulate. We cannot satisfy and defy that postulate at the same time.
If we do not insist on this point, we shall find that we are reading non-Euclidean
properties into Euclidean geometry, and interpreting the elements of the latter as
straight lines that are not straight, flat planes that are not flat. It is not the
mission of non-Euclidean geometry thus to deny the possibility of Euclidean geometry;
it merely demands a place of equal honor.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Geometry of Surfaces</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us ask the Euclidean geometer whether he can recognize his plane after we have
crumpled it up like a piece of paper en route to the waste basket. He will hesitate
only long enough to recall that in the <span class="pagenum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>special case of superposition he has reserved for himself the privilege of deforming
his own plane, and to realize that he can always iron his plane out smooth again after
we are through with it. This emphasizes the true nature of the two-dimensionality
which is the fundamental characteristic of the plane (and of other things, as we shall
directly see). The plane is two-dimensional in points <i>not</i> because two sets of mutually perpendicular Euclidean straight lines can be drawn
in it defining directions of north-south and east-west, but because a point in it
can be located by means of two measures. The same statement may be made of anything
whatever to which the term &#x201c;surface&#x201d; is applicable; anything, however crumpled or
irregular it be, that possesses length and breadth without thickness. The surface
of a sphere, of a cylinder, of an ellipsoid, of a cone, of a doughnut (mathematically
known as a torus), of a gear wheel, of a French horn, all these possess two-dimensionality
in points; on all of them we can draw lines and curves and derive a geometry of these
figures. If we get away from the notion that geometry of two dimensions must deal
with planes, and adopt in place of this idea the broader restriction that it shall
deal with surfaces, we shall have the generalization which the Euclidean has demanded
that we produce, and the one which in the hands of the modern geometer has shown results.
</p>
<p>In this two-dimensional geometry of surfaces in general, that of the plane is merely
one special case. Certain of the features met in that case are general. If we agree
that we know what we mean by distance, we find that on every surface there is a shortest
<span class="pagenum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>distance between two points, together with a series of lines or curves along which
such distances are taken. These lines or curves we call geodesics. On the plane the
geodesic is the straight line. On surfaces in general the geodesic, whatever its particular
and peculiar shape, plays the same rôle that is played by the straight line in the
plane; it is the secondary element of the geometry, the surface itself and all other
surfaces of its type are the tertiary elements. And it is a fact that we can take
all the possible spheres, or all the possible French-horn surfaces, and conceive of
space <i>as we know it</i> being broken down by analysis into these surfaces instead of into planes. The only
reason we habitually decompose space into planes is because it comes natural to us
to think that way. But geometric points, lines and surfaces must be recognized as
abstractions without actual existence, for all of them lack one or more of the three
dimensions which such existence implies. These figures exist in our minds but not
in the external world about us. So any decomposition of space into geometric elements
is a phenomenon of the mind only; it has no parallel and no significance in the external
world, and is made in one way or in another purely at our pleasure. There isn&#x2019;t a
true, honest-to-goodness geometrical plane in existence any more than there is an
honest-to-goodness spherical surface: so on intrinsic grounds one decomposition is
as reasonable as another.
</p>
<p>Certain of the most fundamental postulates are obeyed by <i>all</i> surfaces. As we attempt to discriminate between surfaces of different types, and
get, for instance, a geometry that shall be valid for spheres <span class="pagenum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>and ellipsoids but not for conicoids in general, we must do so by bringing in additional
postulates that embody the necessary restrictions. A characteristic shared by planes,
spheres, and various other surfaces is that the geodesics can be freely slid along
upon themselves and will coincide with themselves in all positions when thus slid;
with a similar arrangement for the surface itself. But the plane stands almost unique
among surfaces in that it does not force us to distinguish between its two sides;
we can turn it over and still it will coincide with itself; and this property belongs
also to the straight line. It does not belong to the sphere, or to the great circles
which are the geodesics of spherical geometry; when we turn one of these over, through
the three-dimensional space that surrounds it, we find that the curvature lies in
the wrong way to make superposition possible. If we postulate that superposition be
possible under such treatment, we throw out the sphere and spherical geometry; if
we postulate that superposition be only by sliding the surface upon itself we admit
that geometry&#x2014;as Saccheri failed to see, as Lobatchewsky realized, and as Riemann
showed at great length in rehabilitating the &#x201c;obtuse-angled hypothesis.&#x201d; Lobatchewsky&#x2019;s
acute-angled geometry is realized on a surface of the proper sort, which admits of
unrestricted superposition; but it is not the sort of a surface that I care to discuss
in an article of this scope.
</p>
<p>Euclidean geometry is the natural and easy one, I suppose, because it makes it easy
to stop with three dimensions. If we take a secondary element, a geodesic, which is
&#x201c;curved&#x201d; in the Euclidean sense, <span class="pagenum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>we get a tertiary element, a surface, which is likewise curved. Then unless we are
to make an altogether abrupt and unreasonable break, we shall find that just as the
curved geodesic generated a curved surface, the curved surface must give rise to a
&#x201c;curved space&#x201d;; and just as the curved geodesic needed a second dimension to curve
into, and the curved surface a third, so the curved three-space requires a fourth.
Once started on this sort of thing, there doesn&#x2019;t really seem to be any end.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nevertheless, we must face the possibility that the space we live in, or any other
manifold of any sort whatever with which we deal on geometric principles, may turn
out to be non-Euclidean. How shall we finally determine this? By measures&#x2014;the Euclidean
measures the angles of an actual triangle and finds the sum to be exactly 180 degrees;
or he draws parallel lines of indefinite extent and finds them to be everywhere equally
distant; and from these data he concludes that our space is really Euclidean. But
he is not necessarily right.
</p>
<p>We ask him to level off a plot of ground by means of a plumb line. Since the line
always points to the earth&#x2019;s center, the &#x201c;level&#x201d; plot is actually a very small piece
of a spherical surface. Any test conducted on this plot will exhibit the numerical
characteristics of the Euclidean geometry; yet we know the geometry of this surface
is Riemannian. The angle-sum is really greater than 180 degrees; lines that are everywhere
equidistant are not both geodesics.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>The trouble, of course, is that on this plot we deal with so minute a fraction of
the whole sphere that we cannot make measurements sufficiently refined to detect the
departure from Euclidean standards. So it is altogether sensible for us to ask: &#x201c;Is
the universe of space about us really Euclidean in whatever of realized geometry it
presents to us? Or is it really non-Euclidean, but so vast in size that we have never
yet been able to extend our measures to a sufficiently large portion of it to make
the divergence from the Euclidean standard discernible to us?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>This discussion is necessarily fragmentary, leaving out much that the writer would
prefer to include. But it is hoped that it will nevertheless make it clear that when
the contestants in the Einstein competition speak of a non-Euclidean universe as apparently
having been revealed by Einstein, they mean simply that to Einstein has occurred a
happy expedient for testing Euclideanism on a smaller scale than has heretofore been
supposed possible. He has devised a new and ingenious sort of measure which, if his
results be valid, enables us to operate in a smaller region while yet anticipating
that any non-Euclidean characteristics of the manifold with which we deal will rise
above the threshold of measurement. This does not mean that Euclidean lines and planes,
as we picture them in our mind, are no longer non-Euclidean, but merely that these
concepts do not quite so closely correspond with the external reality as we had supposed.
</p>
<p>As to the precise character of the non-Euclideanism which is revealed, we may leave
this to later chapters and to the competing essayists. We need <span class="pagenum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>only point out here that it will not necessarily be restricted to the matter of parallelism.
The parallel postulate is of extreme interest to us for two reasons; first because
historically it was the means by which the possibilities and the importance of non-Euclidean
geometry were forced upon our attention; and second because it happens to be the immediate
ground of distinction between Euclidean geometry and two of the most interesting alternatives.
But Euclidean geometry is characterized, not by a single postulate, but by a considerable
number of postulates. We may attempt to omit any one of these so that its ground is
not specifically covered at all, or to replace any one of them by a direct alternative.
We might conceivably do away with the superposition postulate entirely, and demand
that figures be proved equivalent, if at all, by some more drastic test. We might
do away with the postulate, first properly formulated by Hilbert, on which our ideas
of the property represented in the word &#x201c;between&#x201d; depend. We might do away with any
single one of the Euclidean postulates, or with any combination of two or more of
them. In some cases this would lead to a lack of categoricity and we should get no
geometry at all; in most cases, provided we brought a proper degree of astuteness
to the formulation of alternatives for the rejected postulates, we should get a perfectly
good system of non-Euclidean geometry: one realized, if at all, by other elements
than the Euclidean point, line and plane, and one whose elements behave toward one
another differently from the Euclidean point, line and plane.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>Merely to add definiteness to this chapter, I annex here the statement that in the
geometry which Einstein builds up as more nearly representing the true external world
than does Euclid&#x2019;s, we shall dispense with Euclid&#x2019;s (implicit) assumption, underlying
his (explicitly stated) superposition postulate, to the effect that the act of moving
things about does not affect their lengths. We shall at the same time dispense with
his parallel postulate. And we shall add a fourth dimension to his three&#x2014;not, of course,
anything in the nature of a fourth Euclidean straight line perpendicular, in Euclidean
space, to three lines that are already perpendicular to each other, but something
quite distinct from this, whose nature we shall see more exactly in the next chapter.
If the present chapter has made it clear that it is proper for us to do this, and
has prevented anyone from supposing that the results of doing it must be visualized
in a Euclidean space of three dimensions or of any number of dimensions, it will have
served its purpose.

<p class="first">Seeking a basis for the secure formulation of his results, and especially a means
for expressing mathematically the facts of the dependence which he had found to exist
between time and space, Einstein fell back upon the prior work of Minkowski. It may
be stated right here that the idea of time as a fourth dimension is not particularly
a new one. It has been a topic of abstract speculation for the best part of a century,
even on the part of those whose notions of the fourth dimension were pretty closely
tied down to the idea of a fourth dimension of Euclidean point-space, which would
be marked by a fourth real line, perpendicular to the other three, and visible to
us if we were only able to see it. Moreover, every mathematician, whether or not he
be inclined to this sort of mental exercise, knows well that whenever time enters
his equations at all, it does so on an absolutely equal footing with each of his space
coordinates, so that as far as his algebra is concerned he could never distinguish
between them. When the variables <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span> come to the mathematician in connection <span class="pagenum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>with some physical investigation, he knows before he starts that the first three represent
the dimensions of Euclidean three-space and that the last stands for time. But if
the algebraic expressions of such a problem were handed to him independently of all
physical tie-up, he would never be able to tell, from them alone, whether one of the
four variables represented time, or if so, which one to pick out for this distinction.
</p>
<p>It was Minkowski who first formulated all this in a form susceptible of use in connection
with the theory of relativity. His starting point lies in the distinction between
the point and the event. Mr. Francis has brought this out rather well in his essay,
being the only competitor to present the Euclidean geometry as a real predecessor
of Newtonian science, rather than as a mere part of the Newtonian system. I think
his point here is very well taken. As he says, Euclid looked into the world about
him and saw it composed of points. Ignoring all dynamic considerations, he built up
in his mind a static world of points, and constructed his geometry as a scientific
machine for dealing with this world in which motion played no part. It could to be
sure be introduced by the observer for his own purposes, but when so introduced it
was specifically postulated to be a matter of no moment at all to the points or lines
or figures that were moved. It was purely an observational device, intended for the
observer&#x2019;s convenience, and in the bargain a mental device, calling for no physical
action and the play of no force. So far as Euclid in his daily life was obliged to
take cognizance of the fact that in the world of work-a-day <span class="pagenum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>realities motion existed, he must, as a true Greek, have looked upon this as a most
unfortunate deviation of the reality from his beautiful world of intellectual abstraction,
and as something to be deplored and ignored. Even in their statuary the Greeks clung
to this idea. A group of marvelous action, like the Laocoon, they held to be distinctly
a second rate production, a prostitution of the noble art; their ideal was a figure
like the majestic Zeus&#x2014;not necessarily a mere bust, be it understood, but always a
figure in repose without action. Their statuary stood for things, not for action,
just as their geometry stood for points, not for events.
</p>
<p>Galileo and Newton took a different viewpoint. They were interested in the world as
it is, not as it ought to be; and if motion appears to be a fundamental part of that
world, they were bound to include it in their scheme. This made it necessary for them
to pay much more attention to the concept of time and its place in the world than
did the Greeks. In the superposition process, and even when he allowed a curve to
be generated by a moving point, the sole interest which Euclid had in the motion was
the effect which was to be observed upon his static figures after its completion.
In this effect the rate of the motion did not enter. So all questions of velocity
and time are completely ignored, and we have in fact the curious spectacle of motion
without time.
</p>
<p>To Galileo and Newton, on the other hand, the time which it took a body to pass from
one point of its path to another was of paramount importance. The motion itself was
the object of their study, and they recognized the part played by velocity. But <span class="pagenum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>Galileo and Newton were still sufficiently under the influence of Euclid to fit the
observed phenomena of motion, so far as they could, upon Euclid&#x2019;s static world of
points. This they effected by falling in with the age-old procedure of regarding time
and space as something entirely disassociated and distinct. The motion of an object&#x2014;in
theory, of a point&#x2014;was to be recorded by observing its successive positions. With
each of these positions a time was to be associated, marking the instant at which
the point attained that position. But in the face of this association, space and time
were to be maintained as entirely separate entities.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Four-Dimensional World of Events</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This severe separation of time and space Minkowski has now questioned, with the statement
that the elements of which the external world is composed, and which we observe, are
not points at all, but are <i>events</i>. This calls for a revision of our whole habit of thought. It means that the perceptual
world is four-dimensioned, not three-dimensioned as we have always supposed; and it
means, at the very least, that the distinction between time and space is not so fundamental
as we had supposed.
</p>
<p>[This should not impress us as strange or <span class="corr" id="xd29e3176" title="Source: incomphehensible">incomprehensible</span>. What do we mean when we say that a plane is two-dimensional? Simply that two coordinates,
two numbers, must be given to specify the position of any point of the plane. Similarly
for a point in the space of our accustomed concepts we must give three numbers to
fix the position&#x2014;as <span class="pagenum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>by giving the latitude and longitude of a point on the earth and its height above
sea-level. So we say this space is three-dimensional. But a material body is not merely
somewhere; it is somewhere now,]<sup><a href="#au182">182</a></sup> or <i>was</i> somewhere yesterday, or <i>will be</i> somewhere tomorrow. The statement of position for a material object is meaningless
unless we at the same time specify the time at which it held that position. [If I
am considering the life-history of an object on a moving train, I must give three
space-coordinates and one time-coordinate to fix each of its positions.]<sup><a href="#au182">182</a></sup> And each of its positions, with the time pertaining to that position, constitutes
an event. The dynamic, ever-changing world about us, that shows the same aspect at
no two different moments, is a world of events; and since four measures or coordinates
are required to fix an event, we say this world of events is four-dimensional. If
we wish to test out the soundness of this viewpoint, we may well do so by asking whether
the naming of values for the four coordinates fixes the event uniquely, as the naming
of three under the old system fixes the point uniquely.
</p>
<p>Suppose we take some particular event as the one from which to measure, and agree
upon the directions to be taken by our space axes, and make any convention about our
time-axis which subsequent investigation may show to be necessary. Certainly then
the act of measuring so many miles north, and so many west, and so many down, and
so many seconds backward, brings us to a definite time and place&#x2014;which is to say,
to a definite event. Perhaps nothing &#x201c;happened&#x201d; there, in the sense in which we <span class="pagenum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>usually employ the word; but that is no more serious than if we were to locate a point
with reference to our familiar space coordinate system, and find it to lie in the
empty void of interstellar space, with no material body occupying it. In this second
case we still have a point, which requires, to insure its existence and location,
three coordinates and nothing more; in the first case we still have an event, which
requires for <i>its</i> existence and definition four coordinates and nothing more. It is not an event about
which the headline writers are likely to get greatly excited; but what of that? It
is there, ready and waiting to define any physical happening that falls upon it, just
as the geometer&#x2019;s point is ready and waiting to define any physical body that chances
to fall upon <i>it</i>.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">A Continuum of Points</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is now in order to introduce a word, which I shall have to confess the great majority
of the essayists introduce, somewhat improperly, without explanation. But when I attempt
to explain it, I realize quite well why they did this. They had to have it; and they
didn&#x2019;t have space in their three thousand words to talk adequately about it and about
anything else besides. The mathematician knows very well indeed what he means by a
continuum; but it is far from easy to explain it in ordinary language. I think I may
do best by talking first at some length about a straight line, and the points on it.
</p>
<p>If the line contains only the points corresponding <span class="pagenum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>to the integral distances 1, 2, 3, etc., from the starting point, it is obviously
not continuous&#x2014;there are gaps in it vastly more inclusive than the few (comparatively
speaking) points that are present. If we extend the limitations so that the line includes
all points corresponding to ordinary proper and improper fractions like ¼ and 17&#x2044;29
and 1633&#x2044;7&#x200b;&#x2014;what the mathematician calls the rational numbers&#x2014;we shall apparently
fill in these gaps; and I think the layman&#x2019;s first impulse would be to say that the
line is now continuous. Certainly we cannot stand now at one point on the line and
name the &#x201c;next&#x201d; point, as we could a moment ago. There is no &#x201c;next&#x201d; rational number
to 116&#x2044;125&#x200b;, for instance; 115&#x2044;124 comes before it and 117&#x2044;126 comes after it, but
between it and either, or between it and any other rational number we might name,
lie many others of the same sort. Yet in spite of the fact that the line containing
all these rational points is now &#x201c;dense&#x201d; (the technical term for the property I have
just indicated), it is still not continuous; for I can easily define numbers that
are not contained in it&#x2014;irrational numbers in infinite variety like <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f162.1.svg" alt="StartRoot 2 EndRoot" title="StartRoot 2 EndRoot" class="f162.1frml"></span>; or, even worse, the number pi = 3.141592 &#x2026; which defines the ratio of the circumference
of a circle to the diameter, and many other numbers of similar sort.
</p>
<p>If the line is to be continuous, there may be no holes in it at all; it must have
a point corresponding to every number I can possibly name. Similarly for the plane,
and for our three-space; if they are to be continuous, the one must contain a point
for every possible pair of numbers <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>, and the other for <span class="pagenum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>every possible set of three numbers <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>, that I can name. There may be no holes in them at all.
</p>
<p>A line is a continuum of points. A plane is a continuum of points. A three-space is
a continuum of points. These three cases differ only in their dimensionality; it requires
but one number to determine a point of the first continuum, two and three respectively
in the second and third cases. But the essential feature is not that a continuum shall
consist of points, or that we shall be able to visualize a pseudo-real existence for
it of just the sort that we can visualize in the case of line, plane and point. The
essential thing is merely that it shall be an aggregate of elements numerically determined
in such a way as to leave no holes, but to be just as continuous as the real number
system itself. Examples, however, aside from the three which I have used, are difficult
to construct of such sort that the layman shall grasp them readily; so perhaps, fortified
with the background of example already presented, I may venture first upon a general
statement.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Suppose we have a set of &#x201c;elements&#x201d; of some sort&#x2014;any sort. Suppose that these elements
possess one or more fundamental identifying characteristics, analogous to the coordinates
of a point, and which, like these coordinates, are capable of being given numerical
values. Suppose we find that no two elements of the set possess identically the same
set of defining values. Suppose finally&#x2014;and this is the critical test&#x2014;that the elements
of the set are such <span class="pagenum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>that, no matter what numerical values we may specify, it we <i>do</i> specify the proper number of defining magnitudes we define by these <i>an actual element of the set</i>, that corresponds to this particular collection of values. Our elements then share
with the real number system the property of leaving no holes, of constituting a continuous
succession in every dimension which they possess. We have then a continuum. Whatever
its elements, whatever the character of their numerical identifiers, whatever the
number <i>n</i> of these which stands for its dimension, there may be no holes or we have no continuum.
There must be an element for every possible combination of <i>n</i> numbers we can name, and no two of these combinations may give the same element.
Granted this condition, our elements constitute a continuum.
</p>
<p>As I have remarked, it is not easy to cite examples of continua which shall mean anything
to the person unaccustomed to the term. The totality of carbon-oxygen-nitrogen-hydrogen
compounds suggested by one essayist as an example is not a continuum at all, for the
set contains elements corresponding only to integer values of the numbers which tell
us how many atoms of each substance occur in the molecule. We cannot have a compound
containing <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f164.1.svg" alt="StartRoot 2 EndRoot" title="StartRoot 2 EndRoot" class="f164.1frml"></span> carbon atoms, or <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f164.2.svg" alt="3 pi" title="3 pi" class="f164.2frml"></span> oxygen atoms. Perhaps the most satisfactory of the continua, outside the three Euclidean
space-continua already cited, [is the manifold of music notes. This is four-dimensional;
each note has four distinctions&#x2014;length, pitch, intensity, timbre&#x2014;to distinguish it
perfectly, to tell how long, how high, how loud, how rich.]<sup><a href="#au263">263</a></sup> We might have a little difficulty in reducing the characteristic of richness to <span class="pagenum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>numerical expression, but presumably it could be done; and we should then be satisfied
that every possible combination of four values, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>l</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>p</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>i</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span> for these four identifying characteristics would give us a musical effect, and one
to be confused with no other.
</p>
<p>There is in the physical world a vast quantity of continua of one sort or another.
The music-note continuum brings attention to the fact that not all of these are such
that their elements make their appeal to the visual sense. This remark is a pertinent
one; for we are by every right of heritage an eye-minded race, and it is frequently
necessary for us to be reminded that so far as the external world is concerned, the
verdict of every other sense is entirely on a par with that of sight. The things which
we really see, like matter, and the things which we abstract from these visual impressions,
like space, are by no means all there is to the world.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If we are dealing with a continuum of any sort whatever having one or two or three
dimensions, we are able to represent it graphically by means of the line, the plane,
or the three-space. The same set of numbers that defines an element of the given continuum
likewise defines an element of the Euclidean continuum of the same dimensionality;
so the one continuum corresponds to the other, element for element, and either may
stand for the other. But if we have a continuum of four or more dimensions, this representation
breaks down in the absence of a real, four-dimensional Euclidean point-space to <span class="pagenum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>serve as a picture. This does not in the least detract from the reality of the continuum
which we are thus prevented from representing graphically in the accustomed fashion.
</p>
<p>The Euclidean representation, in fact, may in some cases be unfortunate&#x2014;it may be
so entirely without significance as to be actually misleading. For in the Euclidean
continuum of points, be it line, plane or three-space, there are certain things which
we ordinarily regard as secondary derived properties, but which possess a great deal
of significance none the less.
</p>
<p>In particular, in the Euclidean plane and in Euclidean three-space, there is the distance
between two points. I have indicated, in the chapter on non-Euclidean geometry, that
the parallel postulate of Euclid, which distinguishes his geometry from others, could
be replaced by any one of numerous other postulates. Grant Euclid&#x2019;s postulate and
you can prove any of these substitutes; grant any of the substitutes and you can prove
Euclid&#x2019;s postulate. Now it happens that there is one of these substitutes to which
modern analysis has given a position of considerable importance. It is merely our
good old friend the Pythagorean theorem, that the square on the <span class="corr" id="xd29e3291" title="Source: hypothenuse">hypotenuse</span> equals the sum of the squares on the sides; but it is dressed in new clothes for
the present occasion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Francis&#x2019; discussion of this part of the subject, and especially his figure, ought
to make it clear that this theorem can be considered as dealing with the distance
between any two points. When we so consider it, and take it as the fundamental, defining
postulate <span class="pagenum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>of Euclidean geometry which distinguishes this geometry from others, we have a statement
of considerable content. We have, first, that the characteristic property of Euclidean
space is that the distance between two points is given by the square root of the sum
of the squares of the coordinate-differences for these points&#x2014;by the expression
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f167.1.svg" alt="upper D equals StartRoot left-parenthesis upper X minus x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Y minus y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Z minus z right-parenthesis squared EndRoot comma" title="upper D equals StartRoot left-parenthesis upper X minus x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Y minus y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Z minus z right-parenthesis squared EndRoot comma" class="f167.1frml"></span>
where the large letters represent the coordinates of the one point and the small ones
those of the other. We have more than this, however; we have that this distance is
the same for all observers, no matter how different their values for the individual
coordinates of the individual points. And we have, finally, as a direct result of
looking upon the thing from this viewpoint, that the expression for <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>D</i></span> is an &#x201c;invariant&#x201d;; which simply means that every observer may use the same expression
in calculating the value of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>D</i></span> in terms of <i>his own</i> values for the coordinates involved. The distance between two points in our space
is given numerically by the square root of the sum of the squares of <i>my</i> coordinate-differences for the two points involved; it is given equally by the square
root of the sum of the squares of <i>your</i> coordinate-differences, or those of any other observer whatsoever. We have then a
natural law&#x2014;<i>the</i> fundamental natural law characterizing Euclidean space. If we wish to apply it to
the Euclidean two-space (the plane) we have only to drop out the superfluous coordinate-difference;
if we wish to see by analogy what would be the fundamental natural law for a <span class="pagenum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>four-dimensional Euclidean space, we have only to introduce under the radical a fourth
coordinate-difference for the fourth dimension.
</p>
<p>If we were not able to attach any concrete meaning to the expression for <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>D</i></span> the value of all this would be materially lessened. Consider, for instance, the continuum
of music notes. There is no distance between different notes. There is of course significance
in talking about the difference in pitch, in intensity, in duration, in timbre, between
two notes; but there is none in a mode of speech that implies a composite expression
indicating how far one note escapes being identical with another <i>in all four respects at once</i>. The trouble, of course, is that the four dimensions of the music-note continuum
are not measurable in terms of a common unit. If they were, we should expect to measure
their combination more or less absolutely in terms of this same unit. We can make
measurements in all three <span class="corr" id="xd29e3325" title="Source: dimension">dimensions</span> of Euclidean space with the same unit, with the same measuring rod in fact. [This
presents a peculiarity of our three-space which is not possessed by all three-dimensional
manifolds. Riemann has given another illustration in the system of all possible colors,
composed of arbitrary proportions of the three primaries, red, green and violet. This
system forms a three-dimensional continuum; but we cannot measure the &#x201c;distance&#x201d; or
difference between two colors in terms of the difference between two others.]<sup><a href="#au130">130</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Accordingly, in spite of the fact that the Euclidean three-space gives us a formal
representation of the color continuum, and in spite of the fact that the hypothetical
four-dimensional Euclidean space would <span class="pagenum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>perform a like office for the music-note continuum, this representation would be without
significance. We should not say that the geometry of these two manifolds is Euclidean.
We should realize that <i>any</i> set of numerical elements can be plotted in a Euclidean space of the appropriate
dimensionality; and that accordingly, before allowing such a plot to influence us
to classify the geometry of the given manifold as Euclidean, we must pause long enough
to ask whether the rest of the Euclidean system fits into the picture. If the square
root of the sum of the squares of the coordinate-differences between two elements
possesses significance in the given continuum, and if it is invariant between observers
of that continuum who employ different bases of reference, then and only then may
we allege the Euclidean character of the given continuum.
</p>
<p>If under this test the given continuum fails of Euclideanism, it is in order to ask
what type of geometry it does present. If it is of such character that the &#x201c;distance&#x201d;
between two elements possesses significance, we should answer this question by investigating
that distance in the hope of discovering a non-Euclidean expression for it which will
be invariant. If it is not of such character, we should seek some other characteristic
of single elements or groups of elements, of real physical significance and of such
sort that the numerical expression for it would be invariant.
</p>
<p>If the continuum with which we have to do is one in which the &#x201c;distance&#x201d; between two
elements possesses significance, and if it turns out that the invariant expression
for this distance is not the Pythagorean <span class="pagenum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>one, but one indicating the non-Euclideanism of our continuum, we say that this continuum
has a &#x201c;curvature.&#x201d; This means that, if we interpret the elements of our continuum
as points in space (which of course we may properly do) and if we then try to superpose
this point-continuum upon a Euclidean continuum, it will not &#x201c;go&#x201d;; we shall be caught
in some such absurdity as trying to force a sphere into coincidence with a plane.
And of course if it won&#x2019;t go, the only possible reason is that it is curved or distorted,
like the sphere, in such a way as to prevent its going. It is unfortunate that the
visualizing of such curvature requires the visualizing of an additional dimension
for the curved continuum to curve into; so that while we can picture a curved surface
easily enough, we can&#x2019;t picture a curved three-space or four-space. But that is a
barrier to visualization alone, and in no sense to understanding.

<p class="first">It will be observed that we have now a much broader definition of non-Euclideanism
than the one which served us for the investigation of Euclid&#x2019;s parallel postulate.
If we may at pleasure accept this postulate or replace it by another and different
one, we may presumably do the same for any other or any others of Euclid&#x2019;s postulates.
The very statement that the distance between elements of the continuum shall possess
significance, and shall be measurable by considering a path in the continuum which
involves other elements, is an assumption. If we discard it altogether, or replace
it by one postulating <span class="pagenum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>that some other joint property of the elements than their distance be the center of
interest, we get a non-Euclidean geometry. So for any other of Euclid&#x2019;s postulates;
they are all necessary for a Euclidean system, and in the absence of any one of them
we get a non-Euclidean system.
</p>
<p>Now the four-dimensional time-space continuum of Minkowski is plainly of a sort which
ought to make susceptible of measurement the separation between two of its events.
We can pass from one element to another in this continuum&#x2014;from one event to another&#x2014;by
traversing a path involving &#x201c;successive&#x201d; events. Our very lives consist in doing just
this: we pass from the initial event of our career to the final event by traversing
a path leading us from event to event, changing our time and space coordinates continuously
and simultaneously in the process. And while we have not been in the habit of measuring
anything except the space interval between two events and the time interval between
two events, separately, I think it is clear enough that, considered as events, as
elements in the world of four dimensions, there is a less separation between two events
that occur in my office on the same day than between two which occur in my office
a year apart; or between two events occurring 10 minutes apart when both take place
in my office than when one takes place there and one in London or on <span class="corr" id="xd29e3353" title="Source: Betelguese">Betelgeuse</span>.
</p>
<p>It is not at all unreasonable, <i>a priori</i>, then, to seek a numerical measure for the separation, in space-time of four-dimensions,
of two events. If we find it, we shall doubtless be asked just what its <span class="pagenum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>subjective significance to us is. This must be answered with some circumspection.
It will presumably be something which we cannot observe with the visual sense alone,
or it would have forced itself upon our attention thousands of years ago. It ought,
I should think, to be something that we would sense by employing at the same time
the visual sense and the sense of time-passage. In fact, I might very plausibly insist
that, by my very remarks about it in the above paragraph, I have sensed it.
</p>
<p>Minkowski, however, was not worried about this phase of the matter. He had only to
identify the invariant expression for distance; sensing it could wait. He found, of
course, that this expression was not the Euclidean expression for a four-dimensional
interval. He had discarded several of the Euclidean assumptions and could not expect
that the postulate governing the metric properties of Euclid&#x2019;s space would persist.
Especially had he violated the Euclidean canons in discarding, with Einstein, the
notion that nothing which may happen to a measuring rod in the way of uniform translation
at high velocity can affect its measures. So he had to be prepared to find that his
geometry was non-Euclidean; yet it is surprising to learn how slightly it deviates
from that of Euclid. Without any extended discussion to support the statement, we
may say that he found that when two observers measure the time- and the space-coordinates
of two events, using the assumptions and therefore the methods of Einstein and hence
subjecting themselves to the condition that their measures of the pure time-interval

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Curvature of Space-Time</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The invariant expression for separation, it will be seen, is in the same form as that
of the Euclidean four-dimensional invariant save for the minus sign before the time-difference
(the appearance of the constant <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> in connection with the time coordinate <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span> is merely an adjustment of units; see page 153). This tells us that not alone is
the geometry of the time-space continuum non-Euclidean in its methods of measurement,
but also in its results, to the extent that it possesses a curvature. It compares
with the Euclidean four-dimensional continuum in much the same way that a spherical
surface compares with a plane. As a matter of fact, a more illuminating analogy here
would be that between the cylindrical surface and the plane, though neither is quite
exact. To make this clear requires a little discussion of an elementary notion which
we have not yet had to consider.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>Our three-dimensional existence often reduces, for all practical purposes, to a two-dimensional
one. The objects and the events of a certain room may quite satisfactorily be defined
by thinking of them, not as located in space, but as lying in the floor of the room.
Mathematically the justification for this viewpoint is got by saying that we have
elected to consider a slice of our three-dimensional world of the sort which we know
as a plane. When we consider this plane and the points in it, we find that we have
taken a cross-section of the three-dimensional world. A line in that world is now
reduced, for us, to a single point&#x2014;the point where it cuts our plane; a plane is reduced
to a line&#x2014;the line where it cuts our plane; the three-dimensional world itself is
reduced to our plane itself. Everything three-dimensional falls down into its shadow
in our plane, losing in the process that one of the three dimensions which is not
present in our plane.
</p>
<p>For simplicity&#x2019;s sake it is usual to take a cross-section of space parallel to one
of our coordinate axes. We think of our three dimensions as extending in the directions
of those axes; and it is easier to take a horizontal or vertical section which shall
simply wipe out one of these dimensions than to take an oblique section which shall
wipe out a dimension that consists partly of our original length, and partly of our
original width, and partly of our original height.
</p>
<p>If we have a four-dimensional manifold to begin with, we may equally shake out one
of the four dimensions, one of the four coordinates, and consider the three-dimensional
result of this process as <span class="pagenum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>a cross-section of the original four-dimensional continuum. And where, in cross-sectioning
a three-dimensioned world, we have but three choices of a coordinate to eliminate,
in cross-sectioning a world of four dimensions we have four choices. By dropping out
either the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, or the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>, or the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>, or the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span>, we get a three-dimensioned cross-section.
</p>
<p>Now our accustomed three-dimensional space is strictly Euclidean. When we cross-section
it, we get a Euclidean plane no matter what the direction in which we make the cut.
Likewise the Euclidean plane is wholly Euclidean, because when we cross-section it
in any direction whatever we get a Euclidean line. A cylindrical surface, on the other
hand, is neither wholly Euclidean nor wholly non-Euclidean in this matter of cross-sectioning.
If we take a section in one direction we get a Euclidean line and if we take a section
in the other direction we get a circle (if the cylindrical surface be a circular one).
And of course if we take an oblique section of any sort, it is neither line nor circle,
but a compromise between the two&#x2014;the significant thing being that it is still not
a Euclidean line.
</p>
<p>The space-time continuum presents an analogous situation. When we cross-section it
by dropping out any one of the three space dimensions, we get a three-dimensional
complex in which the distance formula is still non-Euclidean, retaining the minus
sign before the time-difference and therefore retaining the geometric character of
its parent. But if we take our cross-section in such a way as to eliminate the time
coordinate, this peculiarity disappears. The signs in the invariant expression are
then all <span class="pagenum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>plus, and the cross-section is in fact our familiar Euclidean three-space.
</p>
<p>If we set up a surface geometry on a sphere, we find that the elimination of one dimension
leaves us with a line-geometry that is still non-Euclidean since it pertains to the
great circles of the sphere rather than to Euclidean straight lines. In shaking Minkowski&#x2019;s
continuum down into a three-dimensional one by eliminating any one of his coordinates,
if we eliminate either the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span> or the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>, we have left a three-dimensional geometry in which the disturbing minus sign still
occurs in the distance-formula, and which is therefore still non-Euclidean. If we
omit the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span>, this does not occur. We see, then, that the time dimension is the disturbing factor,
the one which gives to space-time its non-Euclidean character so far as the possession
of curvature is concerned. And we see that this curvature is not the same in all directions,
and in one direction is actually zero&#x2014;whence the attempted analogy with a cylinder
instead of with a sphere.
</p>
<p>Many writers on relativity try to give the space-time continuum an appeal to our reason
and a character of inevitableness by insisting on the lack of any fundamental distinction
between space and time. The very expression for the space-time invariant denies this.
Time <i>is</i> distinguishable from space. The three dimensions of space are quite indistinguishable&#x2014;we
can interchange them without affecting the formula, we can drop one out and never
know which is gone. But the very formula singles out time as distinct from space,
as inherently different in some way. It is not so inherently different as we have
<span class="pagenum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>always supposed; it is not sufficiently different to offer any obstacle to our thinking
in terms of the four-dimensional continuum. But while we can group space and time
together in this way, [this does not mean at all that space and time cease to differ.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Question of Visualization</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To the layman there is a great temptation to say that while, mathematically speaking,
the space-time continuum may be a great simplification, it does not really represent
the external world. To be sure, you can&#x2019;t see the space-time continuum in precisely
the same way that you can the three-dimensional space continuum, but this is only
because Einstein finds the time dimension to be not quite freely interchangeable with
the space dimension. Yet you do perceive this space-time continuum, in the manner
appropriate for its perception; and it would be just as sensible to throw out the
space continuum itself on the ground that perception of the two is not of exactly
the same sort, as to throw out the space-time continuum on this ground. With appropriate
conventions, either may stand as the mental picture of the external world; it is for
us to choose which is the more convenient and useful image. Einstein tells us that
his image is the better, and tells us why.
</p>
<p>Before we look into this, we must let him tell us something more about the geometry
of his continuum. What he tells us is, in its essentials, just <span class="pagenum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>this. The observer in a pure space continuum of three dimensions finds that as he
changes his position, his right-and-left, his backward-and-forward, and his up-and-down
are not fixed directions inherent in nature, but are fully interchangeable. The observers,
in the adjoined sketch, whose verticals are as indicated by the arrows, find very
different vertical and horizontal components for the distance between the points <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>P</i></span>; a similar situation would prevail if we used all three space directions. The statement
analogous to this for Einstein&#x2019;s four-dimensional continuum of space and time combined
</p>
<div class="figure p163width"><img src="images/p163.png" alt="" width="489" height="392"></div><p>
is that, as observers change their <i>relative motion</i>, their time axes take slightly different directions, so that what is purely space
or purely time for the one becomes space with a small component in the time direction,
or time with a small component in the space direction, for the other. This it will
be seen explains fully why observers in relative motion can <span class="pagenum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>differ about space and time measurements. We should not be at all surprised if the
two observers of the figure reported different values for horizontals and verticals;
we should realize that what was vertical for one had become partly horizontal for
the other. It is just so, says Einstein, with his observers of time and space who
are in relative motion to one another; what one sees as space the other sees as partly
time, because their time axes do not run quite parallel.
</p>
<p>The natural question here, of course, is &#x201c;Well, where are their time axes?&#x201d; If you
know what to look for, of course, you ought to be able to perceive them in just the
way you perceive ordinary time intervals&#x2014;with the reservation that they are imaginary,
after all, just like your space axes, and that you must only expect to see them in
imagination. If you look for a fourth axis in Euclidean three-space to represent your
time axis, you will of course not find it. But you will by all means agree with me
that your time runs in a definite direction; and this it is that defines your time
axis. Einstein adds that if you and I are in relative motion, my time does not run
in quite the same direction as yours.
</p>
<p>How shall we prove it? Well, how would we prove it if he told us that our space axes
did not run in precisely the same direction? Of course we could not proceed through
direct measures upon the axes themselves; we know these are imaginary. What we should
do would be to strike out, each of us, a very long line indeed in what seemed the
true horizontal direction; and we should hope that if we made them long enough, and
measured them <span class="pagenum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>accurately enough, we should be able to detect any divergence that might exist. This
is precisely what we must do with our time axes if we wish to verify Einstein&#x2019;s statement
that they are not precisely parallel; and what better evidence could we demand of
the truth of this statement than the evidence already presented&#x2014;that when we measure
our respective time components between two events, we get different results?

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">What It All Leads To</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The preceding chapters have been compiled and written with a view to putting the reader
in a state of mind and in a state of informedness which shall enable him to derive
profit from the reading of the actual competing essays which make up the balance of
the book. For this purpose it has been profitable to take up in detail the preliminaries
of the Special Theory of Relativity, and to allow the General Theory to go by default,
in spite of the fact that it is the latter which constitutes Einstein&#x2019;s contribution
of importance to science. The reason for this is precisely the same as that for taking
up Euclidean geometry and mastering it before proceeding to the study of Newtonian
mechanics. The fundamental ideas of the two theories, while by no means identical,
are in general terms the same; and the conditions surrounding their application to
the Special Theory are so very much simpler than those which confront us when we apply
them to the more general case, that this may be taken as the controlling factor in
a popular presentation. We cannot omit <span class="pagenum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>the General Theory from consideration, of course; but we can omit it from our preliminary
discussion, and leave its development to the complete essays which follow, and which
in almost every case give it the larger half of their space which its larger content
demands. In the process of the slow and difficult preparation of the lay mind for
the assimilation of an altogether new set of fundamental ideas, it is altogether desirable
to give the Special Theory, with its simpler applications of these ideas, a place
out of proportion to its importance in Einstein&#x2019;s completed structure; and this we
have therefore done.
</p>
<p>The Special Theory, postulating the relativity of uniform motion and deducing the
consequences of that relativity, is often referred to as a &#x201c;special case&#x201d; of the General
Theory, in which this restriction of uniformity is removed. This is not strictly speaking
correct. The General Theory, when we have formulated it, will call our attention to
something which we really knew all the time, but to which we chose not to give heed&#x2014;that
in the regions of space to which we have access, uniform motion does not exist. All
bodies in these regions are under the gravitational influence of the other bodies
therein, and this influence leads to accelerated motion. Nothing in our universe can
possibly travel at uniform velocity; the interference of the rest of the bodies in
the universe prevents this.
</p>
<p>Obviously, we ought not to apply the term &#x201c;special case&#x201d; to a case that never occurs.
Nevertheless, this case is of extreme value to us in our mental processes. Many of
the motions with which we are <span class="pagenum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>concerned are so nearly at constant velocity that we find it convenient to treat them
as though they were uniform, either ignoring the resulting error or correcting for
it at the end of our work. In many other cases we are able to learn what actually
occurs under accelerated motion by considering what <i>would have occurred</i> under uniform motion were such a thing possible. Science is full of complications
which we unravel in this fashion. The physicist deals with gas pressures by assuming
temperatures to be constant, though he knows temperature never is constant; and in
turn he deals with temperatures by assuming pressures to be constant. After this,
he is able to predict what will happen when, as in nature, pressures and temperatures
are varying simultaneously. By using as a channel of attack the artificially simple
case that never occurs, we get a grip on the complex case that gives us a true picture
of the phenomenon. And because in actual nature we can come as close as we please
to this artificial case, by supposing the variable factor to approach constancy, so
when we assume it to be absolutely constant we speak of the result as the <i>limiting</i> case. This situation does not occur, but is the limiting case for those that do occur.
</p>
<p>When, in the matter of motion, we abandon the artificial, limiting case of uniform
velocity and look into the general, natural one of unrestricted motion, we find that
the structure which we have built up to deal with the limiting case provides us with
many of the necessary ideas and viewpoints. This is what we expect&#x2014;in it lies the
value of the limiting case. We shall see that the relativity of time and space, <span class="pagenum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>established for the limiting case, holds good in the general one. We shall see that
the idea of the four-dimensional space-time continuum as representing the external
world persists, forming the whole background of the General Theory much more definitely
than in the Special Theory. Incidentally we shall see that the greater generality
of the case under consideration will demand a greater degree of generality in the
geometry of this continuum, a non-Euclideanism of a much more whole-hearted type than
that of the Special Theory. But all the revisions of fundamental concepts which we
have been at such pains to make for the sake of the Special Theory will remain with
us in the General. With this we may consider our preliminary background as established,
and give our attention to the essayists, who will try to take us more deeply into
the subject than we have yet gone, without losing us in its intricacies.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The reader is probably acquainted with the method of specifying positions of points
in a plane by their distances from two mutually perpendicular lines, or if the points
are in space by their distances from three mutually perpendicular planes like adjacent
sides of a flat-sided box. The method is in fact in common use for exhibiting relations
between quantities by graphs or diagrams. These sets of axes, as they are called,
together with any scales used for measuring, must be supposed rigid, otherwise the
events or points which they are used to specify are indefinite. The lengths which
locate any point with reference to a set of axes are called its <span class="corr" id="xd29e3501" title="Source: coördinates">coordinates</span>.
</p>
<p>When such systems are used for physical purposes, they must be supplemented by clocks
to enable the times at which events occur to be determined. The clocks must be synchronized,
and must go at the same rate, but it must suffice here to state that this is possible
without indicating how these conditions <span class="pagenum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>can be attained. A system of axes with its clocks will hereinafter be called a Frame
of Reference, and every observer will be supposed to be provided with such a frame
partaking of his motion. All the objects which partake of an observer&#x2019;s motion will
be called his <i>system</i>.
</p>
<p>It is a question whether among all possible frames of reference any one frame or class
of frames is more suited than another for the mathematical statement of physical laws.
This is for experience to decide, and a Principle of Relativity is a statement embodying
the answer.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has been ascertained that all such frames are equally suitable for the mathematical
statement of general <i>mechanical</i> laws, provided that their motion is rectilinear and uniform and without rotation.
This fact is comprehended in the general statement that <i>all unaccelerated frames of reference are equivalent for the statement of the general
laws of mechanics</i>. This is the mechanical principle of relativity<span class="corr" id="xd29e3521" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>It is well recognized however that the laws of dynamics as hitherto stated involve
the assumptions that the lengths of rigid bodies are unaffected by the motion of the
frame of reference, and that measured times are likewise unaffected; that is to say
that any length measured on his own system by either of two relatively moving observers
appears the same to both observers, or that lengths of objects and rates of clocks
do not alter whatever the motion relative to an observer. These assumptions <span class="pagenum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>seem so obvious that it is scarcely perceived that they are assumptions at all. Yet
this is the case, and as a matter of fact they are both untrue.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although all unaccelerated frames of reference are equivalent for the purposes of
mechanical laws, this is not the case for physical laws generally as long as the above
suppositions are adhered to. Electromagnetic laws <i>do</i> alter their form according to the motion of the frame of reference; that is to say,
if these suppositions are true, electromagnetic agencies act in different ways according
to the motion of the system in which they occur. There is nothing <i>a priori</i> impossible in this, but it does not agree with experiment. The motion of each locality
on the earth is continually changing from hour to hour but no corresponding changes
occur in electromagnetic actions. It has however been ascertained that on discarding
these suppositions the difficulty disappears, and electromagnetic laws retain their
form under all circumstances of unaccelerated motion. According to the theory of relativity,
the correct view which replaces these suppositions is deducible from the following
postulates:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1)</span> By no experiment conducted on his own system can an observer detect the unaccelerated
motion of his system.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2)</span> The measure of the velocity of light <i>in vacuo</i> is unaffected by relative motion between the observer and the source of light.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Both these postulates are well established by experiment. <span class="pagenum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>The first may be illustrated by the familiar difficulty of determining whether a slowly
moving train one happens to be sitting in, or an adjacent one, is in motion. The passenger
has either to wait for bumps (that is, accelerations) or else he has to look out at
some adjacent object which he knows to be fixed, such as a building (that is, he has
to perform an experiment on something outside his system), before he can decide.
</p>
<p>The second postulate is an obvious consequence of the wave theory of light. Just as
waves in water, once started by a ship, travel through the water with a velocity independent
of the ship, so waves in space travel onward with a speed bearing no relation to that
of the body which originated them. The statement however is based on experiment, and
can be proved independently of any theory of light.
</p>
<p>It is not difficult to deduce from these postulates certain remarkable conclusions
relating to the systems of two observers, A and B, in relative motion, among them
the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1)</span> Objects on B&#x2019;s system appear to A to be shorter in the direction of relative motion
than they appear to B.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2)</span> This opinion is reciprocal. B thinks that A&#x2019;s measurements on A&#x2019;s system are too
great.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3)</span> Similarly for times: each observer thinks that the other&#x2019;s clocks have a slower rate
than his own, so that B&#x2019;s durations of time appear shorter to B than to A, and conversely.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4)</span> Events which appear simultaneous to A do not in general appear so to B, and conversely.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span></li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(5)</span> Lengths at right angles to the direction of motion are unaffected.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(6)</span> These effects vary with the ratio of the relative velocity to that of light. The
greater the relative velocity, the greater the effects. They vanish if there is no
relative velocity.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(7)</span> For ordinary velocities the effects are so small as to escape notice. The remarkable
point however is their occurrence rather than their magnitude.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(8)</span> The observers similarly form different estimates of the velocities of bodies on each
other&#x2019;s systems. The velocity of light however appears the same to all observers.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>Taking into account these revised views of lengths and times the mechanical principle
of relativity may be extended to physical laws generally as follows: <i>All unaccelerated frames of reference are equivalent for the statement of the general
laws of physics.</i> In this form the statement is called the Special, or Restricted, Principle of Relativity,
because it is restricted to unaccelerated frames of reference. Naturally the laws
of classical mechanics now require some modification, since the suppositions of unalterable
lengths and times no longer apply.

<p class="first">Lengths and times therefore have not the absolute character formerly attributed to
them. As they present themselves to us they are relations between the object and the
observer which change as their motion relative to him changes. Time can no longer
be regarded as something independent of position <span class="pagenum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>and motion, and the question is what is the reality? The only possible answer is that
objects must be regarded as existing in four dimensions, three of these being the
ordinary ones of length, breadth and thickness, and the fourth, time. The term &#x201c;space&#x201d;
is applicable only by analogy to such a region; it has been called a &#x201c;continuum,&#x201d;
and the analogue of a point in ordinary three-dimensional space has been appropriately
called an &#x201c;event.&#x201d; By &#x201c;dimension&#x201d; must be understood merely one of four independent
quantities which locate an event in this continuum. In the nature of the case any
clear mental picture of such a continuum is impossible; mankind does not possess the
requisite faculties. In this respect the mathematician enjoys a great advantage. Not
that he can picture the thing mentally any better than other people, but his symbols
enable him to abstract the relevant properties from it and to express them in a form
suitable for exact treatment without the necessity of picturing anything, or troubling
whether or not the properties are those on which others rely for their conceptions.

<p class="first">The limitation of statements of general law to uniformly moving systems is hardly
satisfactory. The very concept of general law is opposed to the notion of limitation.
But the difficulties of formulating a law so that the statement of it shall hold good
for all observers, whose systems may be moving with different and possibly variable
accelerations, are very great. Accelerations imply forces which might be expected
to upset the formulation <span class="pagenum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>of any general dynamical principles, and besides, the behavior of measuring rods and
clocks would be so erratic as to render unmeaning such terms as rigidity and measured
time, and therefore to preclude the use of rigid scales, or of a rigid frame of reference
which is the basis of the foregoing investigation.
</p>
<p>The following example taken from Einstein will make this clear, and also indicate
a way out of the difficulty. A rotating system is chosen, but since rotation is only
a particular case of acceleration it will serve as an example of the method of treating
accelerated systems generally. Moreover, as it will be seen, the attribution of acceleration
to the system is simply a piece of scaffolding which can be discarded when the general
theory has been further developed.
</p>
<p>Let us note the experiences of an observer on a rotating disk which is isolated so
that the observer has no direct means of perceiving the rotation. He will therefore
refer all the occurrences on the disk to a frame of reference fixed with respect to
it, and partaking of its motion.
</p>
<p>He will notice as he walks about on the disk that he himself and all the objects on
it, whatever their constitution or state, are acted upon by a force directed away
from a certain point upon it and increasing with the distance from that point. This
point is actually the center of rotation, though the observer does not recognize it
as such. The space on the disk in fact presents the characteristic properties of a
gravitational field. The force differs from gravity as we know it by the fact that
it is directed <span class="pagenum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>away from instead of toward a center, and it obeys a different law of distance; but
this does not affect the characteristic properties that it acts on all bodies alike,
and cannot be screened from one body by the interposition of another. An observer
aware of the rotation of the disk would say that the force was centrifugal force;
that is, the force due to inertia which a body always exerts when it is accelerated.
</p>
<p>Next suppose the observer to stand at the point of the disk where he feels no force,
and to watch someone else comparing, by repeated applications of a small measuring
rod, the circumference of a circle having its center at that point, with its diameter.
The measuring rod when laid along the circumference is moving lengthwise relatively
to the observer, and is therefore subject to contraction by his reckoning. When laid
radially to measure the diameter this contraction does not occur. The rod will therefore
require a greater proportional number of applications to the circumference than to
the diameter, and the number representing the ratio of the circumference of the circle
to the diameter thus measured will therefore be greater than 3.14159+, which is its
normal value. Moreover the relative velocity decreases as the center is approached,
so that the contraction of the measuring rod is less when applied to a smaller circle;
and the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, while still greater than the normal,
will be nearer to it than before, and the smaller the circle the less the difference
from the normal. For circles whose centers are not at the point of zero force the
confusion is still greater, since the velocities relative to the observer of points
<span class="pagenum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>on them now change from point to point. The whole scheme of geometry as we know it
is thus disorganized. Rigidity becomes an unmeaning term since the standards by which
alone rigidity can be tested are themselves subject to alteration. These facts are
expressed by the statement that the observer&#x2019;s measured space is non-Euclidean; that
is to say, in the region under consideration measurements do not conform to the system
of Euclid.
</p>
<p>The same confusion arises in regard to clocks. No two clocks will in general go at
the same rate, and the same clock will alter its rate when moved about.

<p class="first">The region therefore requires a space-time geometry of its own, and be it noted that
with this special geometry is associated a definite gravitational field, and if the
gravitational field ceases to exist, for example if the disk were brought to rest,
all the irregularities of measurement disappear, and the geometry of the region becomes
Euclidean. This particular case illustrates the following propositions which form
the basis of this part of the theory of relativity:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(1)</span> Associated with every gravitational field is a system of geometry, that is, a structure
of measured space peculiar to that field.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(2)</span> Inertial mass and gravitational mass are one and the same.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(3)</span> Since in such regions ordinary methods of measurement fail, owing to the indefiniteness
<span class="pagenum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>of the standards, the systems of geometry must be independent of any particular measurements.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">(4)</span> The geometry of space in which no gravitational field exists in Euclidean.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e3648src" href="#xd29e3648">1</a></li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>The connection between a gravitational field and its appropriate geometry suggested
by a case in which acceleration was their common cause is thus assumed to exist from
whatever cause the gravitational field arises. This of course is pure hypothesis,
to be tested by experimental trial of the results derived therefrom.
</p>
<p>Gravitational fields arise in the presence of matter. Matter is therefore presumed
to be accompanied by a special geometry, as though it imparted some peculiar kink
or twist to space which renders the methods of Euclid inapplicable, or rather we should
say that the geometry of Euclid is the particular form which the more general geometry
assumes when matter is either absent or so remote as to have no influence. The dropping
of the notion of acceleration is after all not a very violent change in point of view,
since under any circumstances the observer is supposed to be unaware of the acceleration.
All that he is aware of is that a gravitational field and his geometry coexist.
</p>
<p>The prospect of constructing a system of geometry which does not depend upon measurement
may not at first sight seem hopeful. Nevertheless this has been done. The system consists
in defining <span class="pagenum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>points not by their distances from lines or planes (for this would involve measurement)
but by assigning to them arbitrary numbers which serve as labels bearing no relation
to measured distances, very much as a house is located in a town by its number and
street. If this labeling be done systematically, regard being had to the condition
that the label-numbers of points which are close together should differ from one another
by infinitesimal amounts only, it has been found that a system of geometry can actually
be worked out. Perhaps this will appear less artificial when the fact is called to
mind that even when standards of length are available no more can be done to render
lengths of objects amenable to calculation than to assign numbers to them, and this
is precisely what is done in the present case. This system of labeling goes by the
name of &#x201c;Gaussian coordinates&#x201d; after the mathematician Gauss who proposed it.
</p>
<p>It is in terms of Gaussian coordinates that physical laws must be formulated if they
are to have their widest generality, and the general principle of relativity is that
<i>all Gaussian systems are equivalent for the statement of general physical laws</i>. For this purpose the labeling process is applied not to ordinary space but to the
four dimensional space-time continuum. The concept is somewhat difficult and it may
easily be aggravated into impossibility by anyone who thinks that he is expected to
visualize it. Fortunately this is not necessary; it is merely one of these irrelevancies
to which those who are unaccustomed to think in symbols are liable.
</p>
<p>It will now be seen that among physical laws the <span class="pagenum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>law of gravitation stands pre-eminent, for it is gravitating matter which determines
the geometry, and the geometry determines the form of every other law. The connection
between the geometry and gravitation is the law of gravitation. This law has been
worked out, with the result that Newton&#x2019;s law of the inverse square is found to be
approximate only, but so closely approximate as to account for nearly all the motions
of the heavenly bodies within the limits of observation. It has already been seen
that departure from the Euclidean system is intensified by rapidity of motion, and
the movements of these bodies are usually too slow for this departure to be manifest.
In the case of the planet Mercury the motion is sufficiently rapid, and an irregularity
in its motion which long puzzled astronomers has been explained by the more general
law.
</p>
<p>Another deduction is that light is subject to gravitation. This has given rise to
two predictions, one of which has been verified. The verification of the other is
as yet uncertain, though the extreme difficulty of the necessary observations may
account for this.
</p>
<p>Since light is subject to gravitation it follows that the constancy of the velocity
of light assumed in the earlier part of this paper does not obtain in a gravitational
field. There is really no inconsistency. The velocity of light is constant in the
absence of gravitation, a condition which unaccelerated motion implies. The special
principle of relativity is therefore a limiting case of the general principle.

<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Essay in Behalf of Which the Greatest Number of Dissenting Opinions Have Been
Recorded</span></p>
</div>
<p class="byline">BY MONTGOMERY FRANCIS NEW YORK</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have all had experiences, on trains and boats, illustrating our inability to tell,
without looking off to some external body, whether we are at rest or moving uniformly;
and when we do so look, to tell, without reference to the ground or some other point
external to both systems, whether ours or the other be the seat of motion. Uniform
motion must be relative, because we find nowhere in the universe a body in the unique
state of absolute rest from which alone absolute motion might be measured.
</p>
<p>True, the wave theory of light with its homogeneous space-filling ether seemed to
provide a reference standard for the concept of absolute motion, and for its measurement
by experiment with light rays. But when <span class="corr" id="xd29e3683" title="Source: Michelsen">Michelson</span> and Morley looked for this absolute motion they found no trace of it. To the physicist,
observational student of the external world, nothing exists save observationally;
what he can never observe is not there. So: I. <i>By no <span class="pagenum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>means whatever may we regard uniform straight-line motion as other than relative.</i>
</p>
<p>As a further direct consequence of the <span class="corr" id="xd29e3693" title="Source: Michelsen-Morley">Michelson-Morley</span> experiment we have: II. <i>Light in a vacuum presents the same velocity, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f199.1.svg" alt="upper C equals 186 comma 330" title="upper C equals 186 comma 330" class="f199.1frml"></span> miles per second, to all observers whatever their velocity of relative motion.</i> In addition to being experimentally established, this is necessary to support I,
for if light will distinguish between our velocities, its medium is necessarily a
universal standard for absolute motion. But it is contrary to common sense to suppose
that if I pass you at 100 miles per hour, the same light impulse can pass us both
at the same speed, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span>. We feel, instinctively, that space and time are not so constituted as to make this
possible. But the fact has been repeatedly demonstrated. And when common sense and
fundamental concepts clash with facts, it is not the facts that must yield. We have
survived such crises, notably one where we had to change the fundamental concept of
up-and-down; if another one is here, says Einstein, let us meet it.
</p>
<p>This the Special Theory of Relativity does. It accepts Postulates I and II above;
their consequences it deduces and interprets. For extensive demonstration of these
I lack space, and this has been satisfactorily done by others so it is not my chief
duty; but clearly they will be startling. For the very ray of light which refuses
to recognize our relative motion is the medium through which I must observe your system
and you mine.
</p>
<p>It turns out that I get different values for lengths and time intervals <i>in your system</i> than you get, and <span class="pagenum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>vice versa. And we are both right! For me to accept your &#x201c;correction&#x201d; were for me
to admit that you are at absolute rest and I in absolute motion, that your measure
of light velocity is right and mine wrong: admissions barred by the postulates. We
have nothing to correct; we can only recognize the reason for the discrepancy; and
knowing our relative velocity, each can calculate from his own results what the other&#x2019;s
will be. We find, of course, that at ordinary velocities the discrepancy is many times
too small for detection; but at relative velocities at all comparable with that of
light it rises above the observational horizon.
</p>
<p>To inquire the &#x201c;true&#x201d; length is meaningless. Chicago is east of Denver, west of Pittsburgh,
south of Milwaukee; we do not consider this contradictory, or demand the &#x201c;true&#x201d; direction
of Chicago. Einstein finds that the concept of length, between points in space or
events in time, does not as we had supposed represent an intrinsic property of the
points or the events. Like direction, it is merely a relation between these and the
observer&#x2014;a relation whose value changes with the observer&#x2019;s velocity relative to the
object. If our ideas of the part played in the world by time and space do not permit
us to believe this, we must alter these ideas. Let us see how we may do this.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We too have created a distinction in our minds corresponding to no sufficient reality.
Our minds seize on time as inherently separable from space. We see the world made
up of things in a continuum of three space dimensions; to make this dead world <span class="pagenum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>live there runs through it a one-dimensional time continuum, imposed from without,
unrelated.
</p>
<p>But did you ever observe anything suggesting the presence of time in the absence of
space, or vice versa? No; these vessels of the universe always occur together. Association
of the space dimensions into a manifold from which time is excluded is purely a phenomenon
of the mind. The space continuum cannot begin to exist until the time dimension is
supplied, nor can time exist without a place to exist in.
</p>
<p>The external world that we observe is composed, not of points, but of events. If a
point lacks position in time it does not exist; give it this position and it becomes
an event. This world of events is four-dimensional&#x2014;which means nothing more terrifying
than that you must make four measures to locate an event. It does not mean, at all,
that you must visualize four mutually perpendicular lines in your accustomed three-space
or in a four-space analogous to it. If this world of four dimensions seems to lack
reality you will be able to exhibit no better reality for your old ideas. Time belongs,
without question; and not as an afterthought, but as part of the world of events.
</p>
<p>To locate an event we use four measures: <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>X</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>Y</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>Z</i></span> for space, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>T</i></span> for time. Using the same reference frame for time and space, we locate a second event
by the measures <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span>. Minkowski showed that the quantity
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f203.9.svg" alt="StartRoot left-parenthesis upper X minus x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Y minus y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Z minus z right-parenthesis squared minus left-parenthesis upper C upper T minus upper C t right-parenthesis squared EndRoot" title="StartRoot left-parenthesis upper X minus x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Y minus y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Z minus z right-parenthesis squared minus left-parenthesis upper C upper T minus upper C t right-parenthesis squared EndRoot" class="f203.9frml"></span>
is the same for all observers, no matter how different <span class="pagenum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>their <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>&#x2019;s, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>&#x2019;s, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>&#x2019;s and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span>&#x2019;s; just as in the plane the quantity

<p>is the same for all observers, no matter how different their <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>&#x2019;s and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>&#x2019;s.
</p>
<p>Such a quantity, having the same value for <i>all</i> observers, is absolute. In the plane it represents the true, absolute distance between
the points&#x2014;their intrinsic property. In dealing with events it represents the true,
absolute &#x201c;interval,&#x201d; <i>in time and space together</i> between the events. It is not space, nor time, but a combination of the two. We have
always broken it down into separate space and time components. In this we are as naive
as the plane observer who could not visualize the distance <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>PQ</i></span> until it was split into separate horizontals and verticals. He understood with difficulty
that another observer, employing a different reference frame because in different
position, would make the decomposition differently. We understand with difficulty
that another observer, employing a different reference frame because <i>in uniform motion relative to us</i>, will decompose the &#x201c;interval&#x201d; between events into time and space components different
from ours. Time and space are relative to the observer; only the interval representing
space-time is absolute. So common sense stands reconciled to the Special Theory of
Relativity.

<p class="first">Is then our laboriously acquired geometry of points in a three-dimensional space to
go into the <span class="pagenum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>discard? By no means. Jeans, investigating the equilibrium of gaseous masses, found
the general case too difficult for direct attack. So he considered the case where
the masses involved are homogeneous and incompressible. This never occurs; but it
throws such light on the general case as to point the way toward attack on it.
</p>
<p>Euclidean geometry excludes motion, save that engineered by the observer; and then
the time is immaterial. Time does not enter at all; the three space dimensions suffice.
This simple case never occurs where matter exists; but its conclusions are of value
in dealing with more general cases.
</p>
<p>When we look into a world alleged to be that of Euclid and find motion, we may retain
the Euclidean concept of what constitutes the world and invent a machinery to account
for the motion; or we may abandon the Euclidean world, as inadequate, in favor of
a more general one. We have adopted the second alternative.
</p>
<p>Newton&#x2019;s laws tells us that a body free to move will do so, proceeding in a straight
line at uniform velocity until interfered with. We do not ask, nor does the theory
tell us, whence comes the initial motion. There is no machinery to produce it; it
is an inherent property of Newton&#x2019;s world&#x2014;assured by the superposition of the time
continuum upon Euclid&#x2019;s world to make Newton&#x2019;s, accepted without question along with
that world itself.
</p>
<p>But Newton saw that his world of uniform motion, like Euclid&#x2019;s, was never realized.
In the neighborhood of one particle a second is interfered with, forced to give up
its uniform motion and acquire a <span class="pagenum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>constant acceleration. This Newton explained by employing the first of the alternatives
mentioned above. He tells us that in connection with all matter there exists a force
which acts on other matter in a certain way. He does not display the actual machinery
through which this &#x201c;force&#x201d; works, because he could not discover any machinery; he
had to stop with his brilliant generalization of the observed facts. And all his successors
have failed to detect the slightest trace of a machinery of gravitation.
</p>
<p>Einstein asks whether this is not because the machinery is absent&#x2014;because gravitation,
like position in Euclid&#x2019;s world and motion in Newton&#x2019;s, is a fundamental property
of the world in which it occurs. His point of attack here lay in precise formulation
of certain familiar facts that had never been adequately appreciated. These facts
indicate that even accelerated motion is relative, in spite of its apparently real
and absolute effects.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An observer in a closed compartment, moving with constant acceleration through empty
space, finds that the &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; of his cage catches up with objects that he releases;
that it presses on his feet to give him the sensation of weight, etc. It displays
all the effects that he would expect if it were at rest in a gravitational field.
On the other hand, if it were falling freely under gravitational influence, its occupant
would sense no weight, objects released would not leave his hand, the reaction from
his every <span class="pagenum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>motion would change his every position in his cage, and he could equally well assume
himself at rest in a region of space free from gravitational action. Accelerated motion
may <i>always</i> be interpreted, by the observer on the system, as ordinary force effects on his moving
system, or as gravitational effects on his system at rest.
</p>
<p>An alternative statement of the Special Theory is that the observed phenomena of uniform
motion may equally be accounted for by supposing the object in motion and the observer
with his reference frame at rest, or vice versa. We may similarly state the General
Theory: The observed phenomena of uniformly <i>accelerated</i> motion may in every case be explained on a basis of stationary observer and accelerated
objective, or of stationary objective with the observer and his reference system in
accelerated motion. Gravitation is one of these phenomena. It follows that if the
observer enjoy properly accelerated axes (in time-space, of course), the absolute
character of the world about him must be such as to present to him the phenomenon
of gravitation. It remains only to identify the sort of world, of which gravitation
<i>as it is observed</i> would be a fundamental characteristic.
</p>
<p>Euclid&#x2019;s and Newton&#x2019;s systems stand as first and second approximations to that world.
The Special Relativity Theory constitutes a correction of Newton, presumably because
it is a third approximation. We must seek in it those features which we may most hopefully
carry along, into the still more general case.

<p>Newton&#x2019;s system retained the geometry of Euclid. <span class="pagenum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>But Minkowski&#x2019;s invariant expression tells us that Einstein has had to abandon this;
for in Euclidean geometry of four dimensions the invariant takes the form:
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f208.1.svg" alt="StartRoot left-parenthesis upper X minus x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Y minus y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Z minus z right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper T minus t right-parenthesis squared EndRoot comma" title="StartRoot left-parenthesis upper X minus x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Y minus y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper Z minus z right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis upper T minus t right-parenthesis squared EndRoot comma" class="f208.1frml"></span>
</p>
<p>analogous to that of two and three dimensions. It is not the presence of the constant
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>C</i></span> in Minkowski&#x2019;s formula that counts; this is merely an adjustment so that we may measure
space in miles and time in the unit that corresponds to a mile. It is the minus sign
where Euclidean geometry demands a plus that makes Minkowski&#x2019;s continuum non-Euclidean.
</p>
<p>The editor has told us what this statement means. I think he has made it clear that
when we speak of the geometry of the four-dimensional world, we must not read into
this term the restrictions surrounding the kind of geometry we are best acquainted
with&#x2014;that of the three-dimensional Euclidean continuum. So I need only point out that
if we are to make a fourth (and we hope, final) approximation to the reality, its
geometry must preserve the generality attained by that of the third step, if it goes
no further.

<p class="first">Einstein accordingly examined the possible non-Euclidean geometries of four dimensions,
in search of one displaying fundamental characteristics which, interpreted in terms
of space-time, would lead to the observed facts of gravitation. The mathematics of
this investigation is that part of his work which, we are told, but twelve men can
follow; so we may only outline his conclusions.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>If we assume that in the neighborhood of matter the world of space-time is non-Euclidean,
and that its curvature or distortion or non-Euclideanism is of a certain type already
known to mathematicians; that the curvature of this world in the neighborhood of matter
increases with the mass, and decreases as the distance from the matter increases;
and that every particle of matter that is not interfered with travels through space-time
in the most direct path possible <i>in that continuum</i>; then the observed facts of gravitation are accounted for as an inherent geometric
property of this space-time world. We usually say that the presence of matter distorts
this world, and that this distortion gives the track of particles through the region
affected its non-uniform character.
</p>
<p>Gravitation then is not a force at all; it is the fundamental nature of things. A
body free to move through the world must follow some definite path. Euclid says it
will stand still; Newton that it will traverse a straight line in three-space at uniform
time-rate; Einstein that it will move in a &#x201c;geodesic&#x201d; through time-space&#x2014;in every-day
language, that it will fall.
</p>
<p>The numerical consequences of Einstein&#x2019;s theory are, within the limits of observation,
the same as those of Newton&#x2019;s for all bodies save one&#x2014;Mercury. This planet shows a
small deviation from the path predicted by Newton&#x2019;s law; Einstein&#x2019;s theory gives its
motion exactly. Again, when modern research showed that light must be affected by
gravitation, Einstein&#x2019;s theory, because of the extreme velocity of light, deviates
from Newton&#x2019;s, where the <span class="pagenum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>speed is less a determining factor; and observations of starlight deflected by the
sun during the eclipse were in much better accord with Einstein&#x2019;s theory than Newton&#x2019;s.
Moreover, the Special Theory predicts that mass is an observational variable like
length and duration. Radioactive emanations have a velocity high enough to give appreciable
results here, and the prediction is verified, tending to support the general theory
by supporting its limiting case.
</p>
<p>We like always to unify our science; and seldom, after effecting a unification, are
we forced to give it up. Einstein for the first time brings mechanical, electromagnetic
and gravitational phenomena within one structure. This is one reason why physicists
are so open minded toward his theory&#x2014;they want it to be true.

<div class="argument">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">A Statement of What it is All About, in Ideas of One Syllable</span></p>
</div>
<p class="byline">BY HUGH ELLIOT<br>
CHISLEHURST, KENT, ENGLAND</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The invariance of the laws of nature was one of the most popular themes of nineteenth
century philosophy. For it was not till last century that general acceptance was accorded
to the doctrine of the &#x201c;Uniformity of Law,&#x201d; adumbrated in ancient times by Epicurus
and Lucretius. It is now a cardinal axiom of science that the same cause in the same
conditions is always followed by the same effect. There exists in nature no indeterminate
element; all things are governed by fixed laws, and the discovery of these laws is
the main business of science.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is necessary to guard against reading into this statement an erroneous idea of
the content of a &#x201c;law of nature.&#x201d; Such a law is of course not an enactment of any
sort; and it is not even to be thought of as an actual explanation of the how and
why of the phenomena with which it has to do. It really is nothing but an expression
of our belief in the pronouncement of the preceding paragraph, that like conditions
do produce like results. It is a prediction based on <span class="pagenum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>past experience, and is of value merely in that past experience leads us to credit
its accuracy. The composite essay beginning on page 19 discusses this question of
the reality of natural laws, and should be consulted in connection with the present
contribution.&#x2014;<span class="sc">Editor.</span></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>This great philosophic principle was derived of course from the study of natural science;
<i>i.e.</i>, from observations and experiments conducted upon the <i>earth</i>. Their comprehensiveness is therefore limited by the fact that the observer is always
in a state of rest, or nearly so, as compared with the earth. All observers upon the
earth are moving through space at the same velocity; and it was possible to argue
that the uniformity of law might only hold good, when experiments were conducted at
this velocity. An observer moving at very different velocity might discover that the
laws of nature under these new conditions were somewhat different.
</p>
<p>Such a view could indeed never be very plausible, for motion is only a relative conception.
Imagine a universe consisting of infinite &#x201c;empty&#x201d; space, in which there is poised
a single material body. How shall we determine whether this body is at rest, or whether
it is moving at high or low velocity through space? It is never getting nearer to
anything or farther from anything, since there is no other body for it to get nearer
to or farther from. If we say it is moving at a uniform velocity of a thousand miles
a second, our statement really has no significance. We have no more reason for affirming
that it is in motion than we have for affirming that it is at rest. In short, there
is no such thing as <span class="pagenum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>absolute motion; the conception of motion only arises when there are two or more bodies
changing their position relatively to one another. This is what is meant by the relativity
of motion. It seemed therefore improbable that the laws of nature would be different
if the observer were moving at high velocity; for the movement of the observer is
not an absolute quantity, but merely a statement of his relation to other bodies,
and if there <i>were</i> no other bodies, the statement itself would be meaningless.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Behavior of Light</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now among the established laws of nature is that which specifies the velocity of light
moving through a vacuum. If the laws of nature are invariable, this velocity will
always be the same. But consider what would happen under the following circumstances:
Suppose that we are at rest, and that an observer on another body flies past us at
150,000 miles a second. Suppose that at the moment he passes, a piece of flint projecting
from him grazes a piece of steel projecting from us, giving rise to a spark; and that
we both thereupon set about to measure the velocity of the light so produced. After
one second, we should find that the light had traveled about 186,000 miles away, and
since during this second the other observer had traveled 150,000 miles, we should
infer that the light traveling in his direction was only about 36,000 miles ahead
of him. We should also infer that he would find this out by his experiment, and that
he would estimate the velocity of light as only 36,000 miles a second in his <span class="pagenum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>own direction, and 336,000 miles a second in the opposite direction. But if this is
so, then that law of nature which specifies the velocity of light is quite different
for him and for us: the laws of nature must be dependent upon the observer&#x2019;s motion&#x2014;a
conclusion which appears incompatible with the idea of the relativity of motion.
</p>
<p>And it so happens that it is also contradictory to experimental conclusions. Experiments
undertaken to settle the point show that each observer finds the same velocity for
the light of the spark; and after one second, each observer finds that the light has
traveled 186,000 miles from himself. But how is it possible that when it has traveled
186,000 miles in the same direction as the other observer who himself has moved 150,000
miles meanwhile, he should still think it 186,000 miles ahead of him? That is the
initial paradox; and since there has been no room for error in the experiments, we
are forced to conclude that there was something wrong in the assumptions and preconceptions
with which we started.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There can in fact be only one interpretation. If we each find that the light has moved
the same number of miles in the same number of seconds, then we must be meaning something
different when we speak of miles and seconds. We are speaking in different languages.
Some subsidence has occurred in the foundations of our systems of measurement. We
are each referring to one and the same objective fact; but since we describe it quite
differently, and at <span class="pagenum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>first sight incompatibly, some profound alteration must have occurred in our perceptions&#x2014;all
unsuspected by ourselves. It has been shown precisely what this alteration is. A body
moving at high velocity must become flattened in the direction of its motion; all
its measuring apparatus, when turned in that direction, is shortened, so that no hint
of the flattening can be obtained from it. Furthermore, the standards of time are
lengthened out, and clocks go slower. The extent of this alteration in standards of
space and time is stated in the equations of the so-called Lorentz transformation.

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Objection might be urged to the above paragraph on the ground that the connection
of the observer with the variability of measured lengths and times is not sufficiently
indicated, and that this variability therefore might be taken as an intrinsic property
of the observed body&#x2014;which of course it is not.&#x2014;<span class="sc">Editor.</span></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>We are accustomed to describe space as being of three dimensions, and time as being
of one dimension. As a matter of fact, both space and time are &#x201c;ideas,&#x201d; and not immediate
sense-perceptions. We perceive matter; we then <i>infer</i> a universal continuum filled by it, which we call space. If we had no knowledge of
matter, we should have no conception of space. Similarly in the case of time: we <i>perceive</i> one event following another, and we then invent a continuum which we call time, as
an abstraction based on the sequence of events. We do not see space, and we do not
see time. They are not real things, in the sense that matter is real, and that events
are real. They are products of imagination: useful <span class="pagenum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>enough in common life, but misleading when we try to look on the universe as a whole,
free from the artificial divisions and landmarks which we introduce into it for practical
convenience. Hence it is perhaps not so surprising after all that in certain highly
transcendental investigations, these artificial divisions should cease to be a convenience,
and become a hindrance.
</p>
<p>Take for instance our conception of time. It differs from our conception of space
in that it has only one dimension. In space, there is a right and left, an up and
down, a before and after. But in time there is only before and after. Why should there
be this limitation of the time-factor? Merely because that is the verdict of all our
human experience. But is our human experience based on a sufficiently broad foundation
to enable us to say that, under all conditions and in all parts of the universe, there
can be only one time-direction? May not our belief in the uniformity of time be due
to the uniformity of the motion of all observers on the earth? Such in fact is the
postulate of relativity. We now believe that, at velocities very different from our
own, the standard of time would also be different from ours. From our point of view,
that different standard of time would not be confined to the single direction fore
and aft, as we know it, but would also have in it an element of what we might call
right and left. True, it would still be of only one dimension, but its direction would
differ from the direction of our time. It would still run like a thread through the
universe, but not in the direction which we call straight forward. It would have a
<span class="pagenum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>slant in it, and the angle of the slant depends upon the velocity of motion. It does
not follow that because we are all traveling in the same direction down the stream
of time, therefore that stream can only flow in the direction which we know. &#x201c;Before&#x201d;
and &#x201c;after&#x201d; are expressions which, like right and left, depend upon our personal situation.
If we were differently situated, if to be precise we were moving at very high velocity,
we should, so to speak, be facing in a new direction and &#x201c;before&#x201d; and &#x201c;after&#x201d; would
imply a different direction of progress from that with which we are now familiar.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The World of Reality</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But, after all, the objective universe is the same old universe however fast we are
moving about in it, and whatever way we are facing. These details merely determine
the way we divide it up into space and time. The universe is not affected by any arbitrary
lines which we draw through it for our personal convenience. For practical purposes,
we ascribe to it four dimensions, three in space and one in time. Clearly if the time
direction is altered, all dimensions both of space and time must have different readings.
If, for instance, the time direction slopes away to the left, as compared with ours,
then space measurements to right and left must be correspondingly altered. An analogy
will simplify the matter.
</p>
<p>Suppose we desire to reach a point ten miles off in a roughly northeasterly direction.
We might do so by walking six miles due east and then eight miles <span class="pagenum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>due north. We should then be precisely ten miles from where we started. But suppose
our compass were out of order, so that its north pole pointed somewhat to the west
of north. Then in order to get to our destination, we might have to walk seven miles
in the direction which we thought was east, and a little more than seven miles in
the direction which we thought was north. We should then reach the same point as before.
Both observers have walked according to their lights, first due east and then due
north, and both have reached the same point: the one observer is certain that the
finishing point is six miles east of the starting-point, while the other is sure it
is seven miles.
</p>
<p>Now we on the earth are all using a compass which points in the same direction as
regards time. But other observers, on bodies moving with very different velocity,
have a compass in which the time-direction is displaced as compared with ours. Hence
our judgments of distances will not be alike. In our analogy, the northerly direction
corresponds to time, and the easterly direction to space; and so long as we use the
same compass we do not differ in our measurements of distances. But for any one who
has a different notion of the time-direction, not only time intervals but space distances
will be judged differently.
</p>
<p>In short, the universe is regarded as a space-time continuum of four dimensions. A
&#x201c;point&#x201d; in space-time is called an &#x201c;event&#x201d;&#x2014;that which occurs at a specified moment
and at a specified place. The distance between two points in space-time is called
their &#x201c;interval.&#x201d; All observers will agree as to the magnitude <span class="pagenum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>of any interval, since it is a property of the objective universe; but they will disagree
as to its composition in space and time separately. In short, space and time are <i>relative</i> conceptions; their relativity is a necessary consequence of the relativity of motion.
The paradox named at the outset is overcome; for the two observers measuring the velocity
of the light produced as they passed one another, were using different units of space
and time. And hence emerges triumphant the <i>Special Principle of Relativity</i>, which states that the laws of nature are the same for all observers, whether they
are in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Accelerated Motion</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Uniform motion in a straight line is however a very special kind of motion. Our experience
in ordinary life is of motions that are neither uniform nor in a straight line; both
speed and direction of motion are altering. The moving body is then said to undergo
&#x201c;acceleration&#x201d;: which means either that its speed is increasing or diminishing, or
that its direction of motion is changing, or both. If we revert to our former supposition
of a universe in which there is only a single body in &#x201c;empty&#x201d; space, we clearly cannot
say whether it has acceleration any more than whether it is moving, there being no
outside standard of comparison; and the General Principle of Relativity asserts the
invariance of the laws of nature for all states of motion of the observer. In this
case, however, a difference might be <span class="pagenum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>detected by an observer on the moving body itself. It would be manifested to him as
the action of a force; such for instance as we feel when a train in which we are traveling
is increasing or reducing speed, or when, without changing speed, it is rounding a
corner. The force dies away as soon as the velocity becomes uniform. Thus acceleration
reveals itself to us under the guise of action by a force. Force and acceleration
go together, and we may either say that the acceleration is due to the force, or the
impression of force to the acceleration.
</p>
<p>Now when we are traveling with accelerated motion, we have quite a different idea
of what constitutes a straight line from that which we had when at rest or in uniform
motion. If we are moving at uniform velocity in an airplane and drop a stone to the
earth it will appear to us in the airplane to fall in a straight line downward, while
to an observer on the earth it will appear to describe a parabola. This is due to
the fact that the stone gathers speed as it falls; it is subject to the acceleration
associated with gravity. Acceleration obliterates the fundamental difference between
a straight and curved line. Unless we know what is the absolute motion of the stone,
and the two observers, we cannot say whether the line is &#x201c;really&#x201d; a straight or a
curved line. Since absolute motion is an illegitimate conception, it follows that
there is no such thing as &#x201c;really&#x201d; straight or &#x201c;really&#x201d; curved. These are only appearances
set up as a consequence of our relative motions with respect to the bodies concerned.
If there were no such thing as acceleration&#x2014;if the stone fell to the earth at uniform
velocity&#x2014;then an observer on the <span class="pagenum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>earth or anywhere else would agree that it fell in a straight line; and straight lines
would always be straight lines.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Euclidean geometry would be absolutely true. But if we
are in a state of acceleration, then what we think are straight lines are &#x201c;really&#x201d;
curved lines, and Euclidean <span class="corr" id="xd29e4042" title="Source: gometry">geometry</span>, based on the assumption that its lines are straight, must founder when tested by
more accurate measurements. And in point of fact we are in a state of acceleration:
for we are being acted upon by a force&#x2014;namely, the force of gravitation. Wherever
there is matter, there is gravitation; wherever there is gravitation there is acceleration;
wherever there is acceleration Euclidean geometry is inaccurate. Hence in the space
surrounding matter a different geometry holds the field; and bodies in general move
through such space in curved lines.
</p>
<p>Different parts of space are thus characterized by different geometrical properties.
All bodies in the universe proceed on their established courses through space and
time. But when they come to distorted geometrical areas, their paths naturally seem
to us different from when they were moving through less disturbed regions. They exhibit
the difference by acquiring an acceleration; and we explain the acceleration by alleging
the existence of a force, which we call the force of gravitation. But their motions
can in fact be perfectly predicted if we know the geometry of the space through which
they are traveling. The predictions so based have in fact proved more accurate than
those based on the law of gravitation.

of German &#x201c;<span lang="de">Naturforscher <span class="corr" id="xd29e4066" title="Source: and">und</span> Aerzte</span>&#x201d; at Cologne in 1908, has, however, only been completely fulfilled by Einstein&#x2019;s &#x201c;<span lang="de">Allgemeine Relativitäts-theorie</span>&#x201d; of 1915, which incorporated gravitation into the union. In the following pages an
attempt is made to set forth, without using any technical language, the leading ideas
of that theory: I will confine myself to the theory as published by Einstein in November,
1915, which forms a consistent whole, complete in itself; and I will not refer to
later developments, which are still more or less tentative, and not necessary for
the understanding of the theory. The mathematics used by Einstein is the so-called
Absolute Differential Calculus. It is not more difficult or recondite than that used
in other branches of <span class="pagenum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>theoretical physics, but it is somewhat unfamiliar to most of us, because it is not
generally taught in the regular university courses. I will, however, in this essay
abstain from using any mathematics at all, at least, I will not be using it openly.
It is of course unavoidable to use at least the results of the mathematical reasoning,
if not the reasoning itself; but so long as they are not put into formulas they will,
it is hoped, not look so formidable to the reader.
</p>
<p>Referring to the quoted words of Minkowski, we may ask what is meant by &#x201c;reality.&#x201d;
Physical science, like common sense, takes for granted that there <i>is</i> a reality behind the phenomena, which is independent of the person by whom, and the
particular methods by which it is observed, and which is also there when it is not
observed. Strictly speaking, all talk about what is not observed is metaphysics. Nevertheless
the physicist unhesitatingly believes that his laws are general, and that the phenomena
continue to happen according to them when nobody is looking. And since it would be
impossible to prove that they did not, he is fully entitled to his belief. The observed
phenomena are the effects of the action of this reality, of which we assume the existence,
on the observer&#x2019;s senses&#x2014;or apparatus, which are extended and refined sense-organs.
The laws governing the phenomena therefore must convey some information regarding
this reality. We shall never by any means be able to know anything else about it but
just these laws. To all intents and purposes the laws <i>are</i> the reality, if we eliminate from them all that refers to the observer alone. What
refers to the reality is called <span class="pagenum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>&#x201c;absolute,&#x201d; and what involves reference to the observer &#x201c;relative.&#x201d; The elimination
of the relative is one of the things the theory of relativity has set out to do.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To describe the phenomena and derive laws from them, we locate them in space and time.
To do this we use geometry. Here it is that the part contributed by the observer comes
in. There are an infinite number of geometries, and <i>a priori</i> there seems to be no reason to choose one rather than the other. Taking geometry
of two dimensions as an example, we can draw figures on a piece of paper, and discuss
their properties, and we can also do so on the shell of an egg. But we cannot draw
<i>the same</i> figures on the egg as on the paper. The ones will be distorted as compared with the
others: the two surfaces have a different geometry. Similarly it is not possible to
draw an accurate map of the earth on a sheet of paper, because the earth is spherical
and its representation on the flat paper is always more or less distorted. The earth
requires spherical geometry, which differs from the flat, or Euclidean, geometry of
the paper.
</p>
<p>Up to a few years ago Euclidean (<i>i.e.</i> flat) geometry of three dimensions had been exclusively used in physical theories.
Why? Because it is the true one, is the one answer generally given. Now a statement
about facts can be true or false, but a mathematical discipline is neither true nor
false; it can only be correct&#x2014;<i>i.e.</i> consistent in itself&#x2014;or <span class="pagenum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>incorrect, and of course it always is correct. The assertion that a certain geometry
is the &#x201c;true&#x201d; one can thus only mean, that it is the geometry of &#x201c;true&#x201d; space, and
this again, if it is to have any meaning at all, can only mean that it corresponds
to the physical &#x201c;reality.&#x201d; Leaving aside the question whether this reality has any
geometry at all, we are confronted with the more immediately practical consideration
how we shall verify the asserted correspondence. There is no other way than by comparing
the conclusions derived from the laws based upon our geometry, with observations.
It thus appears that the only justification for the use of the Euclidean geometry
is its success in enabling us to &#x201c;draw an accurate map&#x201d; of the world. As soon as any
other geometry is found to be more successful, that other must be used in physical
theories, and we may, if we like, call it the &#x201c;true&#x201d; one.
</p>
<p>Accurate observations always consist of <i>measures</i>, determining the position of material bodies in space. But the positions change,
and for a complete description we also require measures of time. An important remark
must be made here. Nobody has ever measured a pure space-distance, nor a pure lapse
of time. The only thing that can be measured is the distance from a body at a certain
point of space and a certain moment of time, to a body (either the same or another)
at another point and another time. We can even go further and say that time cannot
be measured at all. We profess to measure it by clocks. But a clock really measures
space, and we derive the time from its space-measures by a fixed rule. This rule depends
on the laws of motion of <span class="pagenum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>the mechanism of the clock. Thus finally time is defined by these laws. This is so,
whether as a &#x201c;clock&#x201d; we use an ordinary chronometer, or the rotating earth, or an
atom emitting light-waves, or anything else that may be suggested. The physical laws,
of course, must be so adjusted that all these devices give the same time. About the
reality of time, if it has any, we know nothing. All we know about time is that we
want it. We cannot adequately describe nature with the three space-coordinates alone,
we require a fourth one, which we call time. We might thus say with some reason that
the physical world has four dimensions. But so long as it was found possible adequately
to describe all known phenomena by a space of three dimensions and an independent
time, the statement did not convey any very important information. Only after it had
been found out that the space-coordinates and the time are not independent, did it
acquire a real meaning.
</p>
<p>As is well known the observation by which this was found out is the famous experiment
of Michelson and Morley. It led to the &#x201c;special&#x201d; theory of relativity, which is the
one referred to by Minkowski in 1908. In it a geometry of four dimensions is used,
not a mere combination of a three-dimensional space and a one-dimensional time, but
a continuum of truly fourfold order. This time-space is not Euclidean, since the time-component
and the three space-components are not on the same footing, but its fundamental formula
has a great resemblance to that of Euclidean geometry. We may call it &#x201c;pseudo-Euclidean.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>This theory, which we need not explain here, was very satisfactory so far as the laws
of electromagnetism, and especially the propagation of light, were concerned, but
it did not include gravitation, and mechanics generally. We then had this curious
state of affairs, that physicists actually believed in two different &#x201c;realities.&#x201d;
When they were thinking of light they believed in Minkowski&#x2019;s time-space; when they
were thinking of gravitation they believed in the old Euclidean space and independent
time. This, of course, could not last. Attempts were made so to alter Newton&#x2019;s law
of gravitation that it would fit into the four-dimensional world of the special relativity-theory,
but these only succeeded in making the law, which had been a model of simplicity,
extremely complicated, and, what was worse, it became ambiguous.
</p>
<p>It is Einstein&#x2019;s great merit to have perceived that gravitation is of such fundamental
importance, that it must not be fitted into a ready-made theory, but must be woven
into the space-time geometry from the beginning. And that he not only saw the necessity
of doing this, but actually did it.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Gravitation and its Place in the Universe</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To see the necessity we must go back to Newton&#x2019;s system of mechanics. Newton did two
things (amongst others). He canonised Galileo&#x2019;s system of mechanics into his famous
&#x201c;laws of motion,&#x201d; the most important of which is the law of <i>inertia</i>, which says that:
<span class="pagenum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>a body, that is not interfered with, moves in a straight line with constant velocity</i>.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The velocity, of course, can be nil, and the body at rest. This is a perfectly general
law, the same for all material bodies, whatever their physical or chemical status.
Newton took good care exactly to define what he meant by uniform motion in a straight
line, and for this purpose he introduced the absolute Euclidean space and absolute
time as an essential part of his system of laws at the very beginning of his great
work. The other thing Newton did was to formulate the law of gravitation. Gravitation
was in his system considered as an interference with the free, or inertial, motion
of bodies, and accordingly required a law of its own.
</p>
<p>But gravitation has this in common with inertia, and in this it differs from all other
interferences, that it is perfectly general. All material bodies are equally subjected
to it, whatever their physical or chemical status may be. But there is more. Gravitation
and inertia are actually indistinguishable from each other, and are measured by the
same number: the &#x201c;mass&#x201d;. This was already remarked by Newton himself, and from his
point of view it was a most wonderful accidental coincidence. If an apple falls from
the tree, that which makes it fall is its weight, which is the gravitational attraction
by the earth, diminished by the centrifugal force due to the earth&#x2019;s rotation and
the apple&#x2019;s inertia. In Newton&#x2019;s system the gravitational attraction is a &#x201c;real&#x201d; force,
whereas the centrifugal force is only &#x201c;fictitious&#x201d;. But the one is as real as the
other. The most refined experiments, already begun by Newton himself, have <span class="pagenum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>not succeeded in distinguishing between them. Their identity is actually one of the
best established facts in experimental physics. From this identity of &#x201c;fictitious,&#x201d;
or inertial, and &#x201c;real,&#x201d; or gravitational, forces it follows that locally a gravitational
field can be artificially created or <span class="corr" id="xd29e4132" title="Source: distroyed">destroyed</span>. Thus inside a closed room which is falling freely, say a lift of which the cable
has been broken, bodies have no weight: a balance could be in equilibrium with different
weights in the two scales.
</p>
<p>Having thus come to the conclusion that gravitation is <i>not</i> an interference, but is identical with inertia, we are tempted to restate the law
of motion, so as to include both, thus:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>Bodies which are not interfered with</i>&#x2014;do not move in straight lines, but&#x2014;<i>fall</i>.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Now this is exactly what Einstein did. Only the &#x201c;falling&#x201d; of course requires a precise
mathematical definition (like the uniform motion in a straight line), and the whole
gist of his theory is the finding of that definition. In our earthly experience the
falling never lasts long, very soon something&#x2014;the floor of the room, or the earth
itself&#x2014;interferes. But in free space bodies go on falling forever. The motion of the
planets is, in fact, adequately described as falling, since it consists in nothing
else but obeying Newton&#x2019;s law of gravitation together with his law of inertia. A body
very far removed from all other matter is not subjected to gravitation, consequently
it falls with constant velocity in a straight line according to the law of inertia.
The problem was thus to find a mathematical definition of &#x201c;falling,&#x201d; which would embrace
the uniform straight-line motion <span class="pagenum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>very far from all matter as well as the complex paths of the planets around the sun,
and of an apple or a cannon-ball on earth.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Gravitation and Space-Time</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For the definition of the uniform rectilinear motion of pure inertia Newton&#x2019;s Euclidean
space and independent time were sufficient. For the much more complicated falling
under the influence of gravitation and inertia together, evidently a more complicated
geometry would be needed. Minkowski&#x2019;s pseudo-Euclidean time-space also was insufficient.
Einstein accordingly introduced a general non-Euclidean four-dimensional time-space,
and enunciated his law of motion thus:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>Bodies which are not interfered with move in geodesics.</i></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>A geodesic in curved space is exactly the same thing as a straight line in flat space.
We only call it by its technical name, because the name &#x201c;straight line&#x201d; would remind
us too much of the old Euclidean space. If the curvature gets very small, or zero,
the geodesic becomes very nearly, or exactly, a straight line.
</p>
<p>The problem has now become to assign to time-space such curvatures that the geodesics
will exactly represent the tracks of falling bodies. Space of two dimensions can just
be flat, like a sheet of paper, or curved, like an egg. But in geometry of four dimensions
there are several steps from perfect flatness, or &#x201c;pseudo-flatness,&#x201d; to complete curvature.
Now the law governing the curvature of Einstein&#x2019;s <span class="pagenum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>time-space, <i>i.e.</i>, the law of gravitation, is simply that <i>it can never, outside matter, be curved more than just one step beyond perfect (pseudo-)flatness</i>.
</p>
<p>Since I have promised not to use any mathematics I can hardly convey to the reader
an adequate idea of the difficulty of the problem, nor do justice to the elegance
and beauty of the solution. It is, in fact, little short of miraculous that this solution,
which was only adopted by Einstein because it was the simplest he could find, does
so exactly coincide in all its effects with Newton&#x2019;s law. Thus the remarkably accurate
experimental verification of this law can at once be transferred to the new law. In
only one instance do the two laws differ so much that the difference can be observed,
and in this case the observations confirm the new law exactly. This is the well known
case of the motion of the perihelion of Mercury, whose disagreement with Newton&#x2019;s
law had puzzled astronomers for more than half a century.
</p>
<p>Since Einstein&#x2019;s time-space includes Minkowski&#x2019;s as a particular case, it can do all
that the other was designed to do for electro-magnetism and light. But it does more.
The track of a pulse of light is also a geodesic, and time-space being curved in the
neighborhood of matter, rays of light are no longer straight lines. A ray of light
from a star, passing near the sun, will be bent round, and the star consequently will
be seen in a different direction from where it would be seen if the sun had not been
so nearly in the way. This has been verified by the observations of the eclipse of
the sun of 1919 of May 29.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is one other new phenomenon predicted by the theory, which falls within the
reach of observation with our present means. Gravitation chiefly affects the time-component
of the four-dimensional continuum, in such a way that natural clocks appear to run
slower in a strong gravitational field than in a weak one. Thus, if we make the hypothesis&#x2014;which,
though extremely probable, is still a hypothesis&#x2014;that an atom emitting or absorbing
light-waves is a natural clock, and the further hypothesis&#x2014;still very probable, though
less so than the former&#x2014;that there is nothing to interfere with its perfect running,
then an atom on the sun will give off light-waves of smaller frequency than a similar
atom in a terrestrial laboratory emits. Opinions as yet differ as to whether this
is confirmed or contradicted by observations.
</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>
</p>
<p>The great strength and the charm of Einstein&#x2019;s theory do however not lie in verified
predictions, nor in the explanation of small outstanding discrepancies, but in the
complete attainment of its original aim: the identification of gravitation and inertia,
and in the wide range of formerly apparently unconnected subjects which it embraces,
and the broad view of nature which it affords.
</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>
</p>
<p>Outside matter, as has been explained, the law of gravitation restricts the curvature
of time-space. Inside continuous matter the curvature can be of any arbitrary kind
or amount; the law of gravitation then connects this curvature with measurable properties
of the matter, such as density, velocity, stress, etc. Thus these properties define
the curvature, or, <span class="pagenum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>if preferred, the curvature defines the properties of matter, <i>i.e.</i> matter itself.
</p>
<p>From these definitions the laws of conservation of energy, and of conservation of
momentum, can be deduced by a purely mathematical process. Thus these laws, which
at one time used to be considered as the most fundamental ones of mechanics, now appear
as simple corollaries from the law of gravitation. It must be pointed out that such
things as length, velocity, energy, momentum, are not absolute, but relative, <i>i.e.</i> they are not attributes of the physical reality, but relations between this reality
and the observer. Consequently the laws of conservation are not laws of the real world,
like the law of gravitation, but of the observed phenomena. There is, however one
law which, already before the days of relativity, had come to be considered as the
most fundamental of all, <i>viz</i>: the principle of least action. Now action is absolute. Accordingly this principle
retains its central position in Einstein&#x2019;s theory. It is even more fundamental than
the law of gravitation, since both this law, and the law of motion, can be derived
from it. The principle of least action, so far as we can see at present, appears to
be <i>the</i> law of the real world.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Einstein&#x2019;s general relativity is of such vast compass, being coextensive with the
realm of physical events, that in any brief account a strict selection from its numerous
aspects is prescribed. The old, restricted principle being contained in the general,
we shall treat the latter, its close relations with gravitation, and the significance
of both for our knowledge of space and time. The essence of Einstein&#x2019;s generalization
is its final disentanglement of that part of any physical event which is contributed
by the observer from that which is inherent in the nature of things and independent
of all observers.
</p>
<p>The argument turns upon the fact that an observer must describe any event with reference
to some framework from which he makes measurements of time and distance. Thus, suppose
that at nine o&#x2019;clock a ball is tossed across the room. At one second past nine the
ball occupies a definite position which we can specify by giving the three distances
from the <span class="pagenum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>centre of the ball to the north and west <span class="corr" id="xd29e4215" title="Source: wells">walls</span> and the floor. In this way, refining our measurements, we can give a precise description
of the entire motion of the ball. Our final description will consist of innumerable
separate statements, each of which contains four numbers corresponding to four measurements,
and of these one will be for time and three for distances at the time indicated.
</p>
<p>Imagine now that a man in an automobile looks in and observes the moving ball. Suppose
he records the motion. To do so, he must refer to a timepiece and some body of reference.
Say he selects his wrist-watch, the floor of his auto and two sides meeting in a corner.
Fancy that just as he begins his series of observations his auto starts bucking and
the main-spring of his watch breaks, so that he must measure &#x201c;seconds&#x201d; by the crazy
running-down of his watch, and distances with reference to the sides of his erratic
auto. Despite these handicaps he completes a set of observations, each of which consists
of a time measured by his mad watch and three distances reckoned from the sides of
his bucking machine. Let us assume him to have been so absorbed in his experiment
that he noticed neither the disorders of his watch nor the motion of his auto. He
gives us his sets of measurements. We remark that his seconds are only small fractions
of ours, also his norths and wests are badly mixed. If we interpret his sets in terms
of our stationary walls and sober clock we find the curious paradox that the ball
zigzagged across the room like an intoxicated bee. He obstinately argues that we know
no more than he about how the ball actually moved. For we got a smooth <span class="pagenum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>description, he asserts, by choosing an artificially simple reference framework, having
no necessary relations whatever to the ball. The crooked path plotted from his observations
proves, he declares, that the ball was subject to varying forces of which we in the
room suspected nothing. He contends that our room was being jarred by a system of
forces which exactly compensated and smoothed out the real jaggedness of path observed
by himself. But if we know all about his watch and auto we can easily apply necessary
corrections to his measurements, and, fitting the corrected set to our reference-framework
of walls and clock, recover our own smooth description.
</p>
<p>For consistency we must carry our readjustments farther. The path mapped from our
measurements is a curve. Perhaps the curvature was introduced by some peculiarity
of our reference framework? Possibly our own room is being accelerated upward, so
that it makes the ball&#x2019;s true path&#x2014;whatever that may be&#x2014;appear curved downward, just
as the autoist&#x2019;s zigzags made the path he mapped appear jagged. Tradition attributes
the downward curving to the tug of gravity. This force we say accelerates the ball
downward, producing the curved path. Is this the only possible explanation? Let us
see.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Gravitation and Acceleration</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Imagine a man in a room out of which he cannot see. He notices that when he releases
anything it falls to the floor with a constant acceleration. Further he observes that
all his objects, independently <span class="pagenum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>of their chemical and physical properties, are affected in precisely the same way.
Now, he previously has experimented with magnets, and has remarked that they attract
certain bodies in essentially the same way that the things which he drops are &#x201c;attracted&#x201d;
to whatever is beneath the floor. Having explained magnetic attraction in terms of
&#x201c;forces,&#x201d; he makes his first hypothesis: (A) He and his room are in a strong &#x201c;field
of force,&#x201d; which he designates gravitational. This force pulls all things downward
with a constant acceleration. Here he notes a singular distinction between magnetic
and gravitational &#x201c;forces&#x201d;: magnets attract only a few kinds of matter, notably iron;
the novel &#x201c;force,&#x201d; if indeed a force at all, acts similarly upon all kinds of matter.
He makes another hypothesis: (B) His room and he are being accelerated upward.
</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>
</p>
<p>Either (A) or (B) describes the facts perfectly. By no experiment can he discriminate
between them. So he takes the great step, and formulates the <i>Equivalence Hypothesis</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>A gravitational field of force is precisely equivalent in its effects to an artificial
field of force introduced by accelerating the framework of reference, so that in any
small region it is impossible to distinguish between them by any experiment whatever.</i></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Next reconsidering his magnetic &#x201c;forces,&#x201d; he extends the equivalence hypothesis to
cover all manifestations of force: The effects attributed to forces of any kind whatever
can be described equally well by saying that our reference frameworks are accelerated;
and moreover there is possible no experiment <span class="pagenum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>which will discriminate between the descriptions.
</p>
<p>If the accelerations are null, the frameworks are at rest or in <i>uniform</i> motion relatively to one another. This special case is the &#x201c;restricted&#x201d; principle
of relativity, which asserts that it is impossible experimentally to detect a uniform
motion through the ether. Being thus superfluous for descriptions of natural phenomena,
the ether may be abandoned, at least temporarily. The older physics sought this absolute
ether framework to which all motions could be unambiguously referred, and failed to
find it. The most exacting experiments, notably that of Michelson-Morley, revealed
no trace of the earth&#x2019;s supposed motion through the ether. Fitzgerald accounted for
the failure by assuming that such motion would remain undetected if every moving body
contracted by an amount depending upon its velocity in the direction of motion. The
contraction for ordinary velocities is imperceptible. Only when as in the case of
the beta particles, the velocity is an appreciable fraction of the velocity of light,
is the contraction revealed. This contraction follows immediately from Einstein&#x2019;s
generalization constructed upon the equivalence hypothesis and the restricted relativity
principle. We shall see that the contraction inevitably follows from the actual geometry
of the universe.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e4249src" href="#xd29e4249">1</a>
</p>
<p>Let us return for a moment to the moving ball. Four measures, three of distances and
one of time, are required in specifying its position with reference <span class="pagenum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>to some framework at each point and at each instant. All of these measures can be
summed up in one compendious statement&#x2014;the equations of motion showed how in changing
from our room to his accelerated auto we found a new summary, &#x201c;transformed equations,&#x201d;
which seemed to indicate that the ball had traversed a strong, variable field of force.
Is there then in the chaos of observational disagreements anything which is independent
of all observers? There is, but it is hidden at the very heart of nature.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Paths Through the World of Four Dimensions</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To exhibit this, we must recall a familiar proposition of geometry: the square on
the longest side of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on
the other two sides. It has long been known that from this alone all the metrical
properties of Euclidean space&#x2014;the space in which for 2,000 years we have imagined
we were living&#x2014;can be deduced. Metrical properties are those depending upon measurement.
Now, in the geometry of any space, Euclidean or not, there is a single proposition
of a similar sort which tells us how to find the most direct distance between any
two points that are very close together. This small distance is expressed in terms
of the two sets of distance measurements by which the end-points are located, just
as two neighboring positions of our ball were located by two sets of four measurements
each. We say by analogy that two consecutive positions of the ball <span class="pagenum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>are separated by a small <i>interval</i> of time-space. From the formula for the very small interval of time-space we can
calculate mathematically all the metrical properties of the time and space in which
measurements for the ball&#x2019;s motion must be made. So in any geometry mathematical analysis
predicts infallibly the truth about all facts depending upon measurements from the
simple formula of the interval between neighboring points. Thus, on a sphere the sum
of the angles of any triangle formed by arcs of great circles exceeds 180°, and this
follows from the formula for the shortest (&#x201c;geodesic&#x201d;) distance between neighboring
points on the spherical surface.
</p>
<p>We saw that it takes four measurements, one for time and three for distances, to fix
an elementary event, <i>viz.</i>, the position of the centre of our ball at any instant. A system of all possible
such sets of four measurements each, constitutes what mathematicians call a four-dimensional
space. The study of the four-dimensional time-space geometry, once its shortest-distance
proposition is known, reveals all those relations in nature which can be ascertained
by measurements, that is, experimentally. We have then to find this indispensable
proposition.
</p>
<p>Imagine the path taken by a particle moving solely under the influence of gravitation.
This being the simplest possible motion of an actual particle in the real world, it
is natural to guess that its path will be such that the particle moves from one point
of time-space to another by the most direct route. This in fact is verified by forming
the equations of the free particle&#x2019;s motion, which turn out to be precisely those
that specify a geodesic (most direct line) joining <span class="pagenum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>the two points. On the (two-dimensional) surface of a sphere such a line is the position
taken by a string stretched between two points on the surface, and this is the <i>shortest</i> distance on the surface between them. But in the time-space geometry we find a remarkable
distinction: the interval between any two points of the path taken is the <i>longest</i> possible, and between any two points <i>there is only one longest path</i>. Translated into ordinary space and time this merely asserts that the <i>time</i> taken between any two points on the natural path is the longest possible.
</p>
<p>Recall now that when the line-formula for any kind of space is known <i>all the metrical properties</i> of that space are completely determined, and combine with this what we have just
found, namely, the equations of motion of a particle subject only to gravitation are
the same equations as those which fix the line-formula for the four-dimensional time-space.
Since gravitation alone determines the motion of the particle, and since this motion
is completely described by the very equations which fix all the metrical properties
of time-space, it follows that the metrical (experimentally determinable) properties
of time-space are equivalent to those of gravitation, in the sense that each set of
properties implies the other.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have found the thing in nature which is independent of all observers, and it turns
out to be the very structure of time-space itself. The motion of the free particle
obviously is a thing unconditioned <span class="pagenum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>by accidents of observation; the particle under the influence of gravitation alone
must go a way of its own. And if some observer in an artificial field of force produced
by the acceleration of his reference framework describes the path as knotted, he merely
is foisting eccentricities of his own motion upon the direct path of the particle.
The conclusion is rational, for we believe that time-space exists independently of
any man&#x2019;s way of perceiving it.
</p>
<p>Incidentally note that this space is that of the physical world. For only by measurements
of distances and times can we become aware of our extension in time and space. If
beyond this time-space geometry of measurements there is some &#x201c;absolute geometry,&#x201d;
science can have no concern with it, for never can it be revealed by the one exploring
device we possess&#x2014;measurement.
</p>
<p>We have followed a single particle. Let us now form a picture of several. Any event
can be analyzed into a multitude of coincidences in time-space. For consider two moving
particles&#x2014;say electrons. If they collide they both are in very approximately one place
at the same time. We imagine the path of an electron through time-space plotted by
a line (in four-dimensional space), which will deviate from a &#x201c;most direct&#x201d; (geodesic)
path if the electron is subjected to forces. This is the &#x201c;world-line&#x201d; of the electron.
If the world lines of several electrons intersect at one point in time-space, the
intersection pictures the fact of their coincidence somewhere and somewhen; for all
their world-lines having a time-space point in common, at some instant they must have
been in collision. Each point of a world-line <span class="pagenum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>pictures the position at a certain place at a certain time; and it is the intersections
of world-lines which correspond to physical events. Of what lies between the intersections
we have no experimental knowledge.
</p>
<p>Imagine the world-lines of all the electrons in the universe threading time-space
like threads in a jelly. The intersections of the tangle are a complete history of
all physical events. Now distort the jelly. Clearly the mutual <i>order</i> of the intersections will be unchanged, but the distances between them will be shortened
or lengthened. To a distortion of the jelly corresponds a special choice (by some
observer) of a reference framework for describing the order of events. He cannot change
the natural sequence of events. Again we have found something which is independent
of all observers.
</p>
<p>We can now recapitulate our conclusions and state the principle of relativity in its
most general form.
</p>
<p>(1) Observers describe events by measures of times and distances made with regard
to their frameworks of reference.
</p>
<p>(2) The complete history of any event is summarized in a set of equations giving the
positions of all the particles involved at every instant.
</p>
<p>(3) Two possibilities arise. (A) Either these equations are the same in form for all
space-time reference frameworks, persisting formally unchanged for all shifts of the
reference scheme; or (B), they subsist only when some special framework is used, altering
their form as they are referred to different frameworks. If (B) holds, we naturally
assume that the equations, and the phenomena which <span class="pagenum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>they profess to represent, owe their existence to some peculiarity of the reference
framework. They do not, therefore, describe anything which is inherent in the nature
of things, but merely some idiosyncrasy of the observer&#x2019;s way of regarding nature.
If (A) holds, then obviously the equations describe some real relation in nature which
is independent of all possible ways of observing and recording it.
</p>
<p>(4) In its most general form the principle of relativity states that those relations,
and those alone, which persist unchanged in form for all possible space-time reference
frameworks are the inherent laws of nature.
</p>
<p>To find such relations Einstein has applied a mathematical method of great power&#x2014;the
calculus of tensors&#x2014;with extraordinary success. This calculus threshes out the laws
of nature, separating the observer&#x2019;s eccentricities from what is independent of him,
with the superb efficiency of a modern harvester. The residue is a physical geometry&#x2014;or
geometrical physics&#x2014;of time-space, in which it appears that the times and spaces contributed
by the several observers&#x2019; reference frameworks are shadows of their own contrivings;
while the real, enduring universe is a fourfold order of time and space <span class="corr" id="xd29e4313" title="Source: indisolubly">indissolubly</span> bound together. One observer separates this time-space into his own &#x201c;time&#x201d; and &#x201c;space&#x201d;
in one way, determined by his path through the world of events; another, moving relatively
to the first, separates it differently, and what for one is time shades into space
for another.
</p>
<p>This time-space geometry is non-Euclidean. It is &#x201c;warped&#x201d; (curved), the amount of
warping at <span class="pagenum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>any place being determined by the intensity of the gravitational field there. Thus
again gravitation is rooted in the nature of things. In this sense it is not a force,
but a property of space. Wherever there is matter there is a gravitational field,
and hence a warping of space. Conversely, as long ago imagined by Clifford, wherever
there is a warping of space, there is matter; and matter is resolved ultimately into
wrinkles in time-space.
</p>
<p>To visualize a warped space, consider a simple analogy. A man walks away from a polished
globe; his image recedes into the mirror-space, shortening and thinning as it goes,
and thinning (in the direction of motion) faster than it shortens. Everything around
him experiences a like effect. If he tries to discover this by a footrule it automatically
shortens faster as he turns it into the horizontal position, so his purpose eludes
him. The mirror-space is warped in the direction of the image&#x2019;s motion. So is our
own. For all bodies, as evidenced by the Fitzgerald contraction, shorten in the direction
of motion. And just as the image can never penetrate the mirror-space a greater distance
than half its radius, so probably time-space is curved in such a way that our universe,
like the surface of a sphere, is finite in extent, but unbounded.

<p class="first"><span class="sc">How Einstein Has Substituted the Second for the First in Connection With the Cause
of Gravitation</span></p>
</div>
<p class="byline">BY SAUL DUSHMAN<br>
GENERAL ELECTRIC LABORATORIES SCHENECTADY, N. Y.</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The theory of relativity represents a most strikingly original conception of time
and space, which was suggested by Einstein in order to correlate with all our past
experience certain observations made in recent years. It is therefore extremely comprehensive
in its scope; it demands from us a radical revision in our notions of time and space;
it throws new light on the nature of mass and energy, and finally, it furnishes a
totally new conception of the old problem of gravitation.
</p>
<p>The starting point of the theory is the familiar observation that motion is always
relative: that is, to define the motion of any object we must always use some point
of reference. Thus we speak of the velocity of a train as 40 miles per hour with respect
to the earth&#x2019;s surface, but would find it impossible to determine its absolute speed,
or motion in space, since we know of no star whose position can be spoken of as absolutely
fixed. These and <span class="pagenum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>similar considerations have led to the conclusion, pointed out by Newton and others,
that it is impossible by any mechanical experiments on the earth to measure its velocity
in space.
</p>
<p>However, the results of observations on the phenomena of light and electricity led
to the revival of the same problem under another form. As well known, there was evolved
from these discoveries, the theory that light and electrical energy are of the same
nature, and are in each case manifestations of wave-disturbances propagated through
a hypothetical medium, the <i>ether</i>, with a velocity of 186,000 miles per second.
</p>
<p>The problem therefore arose as to whether the earth and all stellar bodies move through
this ether. In that case it ought to be possible to measure the velocity of the earth
with respect to this medium, and under these conditions we could speak, in a sense,
of absolute motion.
</p>
<p>A large number of experiments has been tried with this end in view. The most famous
of these, and the one which stimulated the subsequent development of the theory of
relativity, was that carried out by Michelson and Morley in 1887. To understand the
<span class="corr" id="xd29e4349" title="Source: signficance">significance</span> of this experiment we shall refer briefly to an analogous observation which is quite
familiar.
</p>
<p>Does it take longer to swim to a point 1 mile up a stream and back or to a point 1
mile across stream and back? The experienced swimmer will answer that the up-and-down
journey takes longer. If we assume that the swimmer has a speed of 5 miles an hour
in still water and that the current <span class="pagenum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>is 3 miles an hour, we find that, while it requires five-eighths hour to make the
up-and-down journey, it takes only one-half hour for the trip across stream and back.
The ratio between the times required for the two journeys is thus five-fourths, and
if this is written in the form
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f249.1.svg" alt="StartFraction 1 Over StartRoot 1 minus left-parenthesis three-fifths right-parenthesis squared EndRoot EndFraction" title="StartFraction 1 Over StartRoot 1 minus left-parenthesis three-fifths right-parenthesis squared EndRoot EndFraction" class="f249.1frml"></span>
it shows how the result depends upon the square of the ratio of the speeds of the
swimmer and the current.
</p>
<p>Now the earth is moving in its orbit about the sun with a velocity of 18 miles per
second. If the earth moves through the ether and a light-beam passes from one mirror
to another and back again, the time taken for this journey ought to be longer when
the light-path is in the direction of the earth&#x2019;s motion than when it is at right
angles to this direction. For we can consider the light as a swimmer having a speed
of 186,000 miles per second and travelling in a stream whose current is 18 miles per
second.
</p>
<p>When Michelson and Morley tried the experiment they could not observe any difference
in the velocity of light in the two directions. The experiment has since been repeated
under various conditions, but always with negative results.
</p>
<p>Einstein&#x2019;s contribution to science consists in interpreting this result as being in
accord with Newton&#x2019;s ideas on mechanical relativity in that it demonstrates the impossibility
of measuring absolute motion, not only by mechanical, but also by optical <span class="pagenum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>or electrical experiments. Consequently the velocity of light must be regarded as
constant and independent of the motion of either source or observer.
</p>
<div id="xd29e4366" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Relativity of Uniform Motion</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us consider some of the consequences which follow from this principle. An observer
travelling with say one-half the velocity of light in the same direction as a ray
of light would find that the latter has the usual velocity of 186,000 miles per second.
Similarly an observer travelling in the opposite direction to that of the light-ray,
with one-half the velocity of light, would obtain the same result.
</p>
<p>Einstein has shown that these conclusions can be valid only if the units of time and
space used by the two observers depend upon their relative motions. A careful calculation
shows that the unit of length used by either observer appears to the other observer
contracted when placed in the direction of their relative motion (but not, when placed
at right angles to this direction), and the unit of time used by either observer appears
to the other too great. Moreover, the ratio of the units of length or of time varies
with the square of the relative speed of the two observers, according to a relation
which is similar to that mentioned above for the swimmer in the current. This relation
shows that as the relative speed approaches that of light the discrepancy between
the units increases.
</p>
<p>Thus, for an observer moving past our earth with a velocity which is nine-tenths that
of light, a meter stick on the earth would be 44 centimeters as measured <span class="pagenum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>by him, while a second on our clocks would be about two and a half seconds as marked
by his clock. Similarly, what he calls a meter length would, for us, be only 44 centimeters
and he would appear to us to be living about two and a half times slower than we are.
Each observer is perfectly consistent in his measurements of time and space as long
as he confines his observations to his own system, but when he tries to make observations
on another system moving past his, he finds that the results which he obtains do not
agree with those obtained by the other observer.
</p>
<p>It is not surprising that in accordance with this conclusion it also follows that
the mass of a body must increase with its velocity. For low velocities the increase
is so small that we cannot ever hope to measure it, but as the velocity of light is
approached the difference becomes more and more appreciable and a body having the
velocity of light would possess infinite mass, which simply means that such a velocity
cannot be attained by any material object. This conclusion has been experimentally
confirmed by observations on the mass of the extremely small negatively charged particles
which are emitted by radioactive elements. Some of these particles are ejected with
velocities which are over nine-tenths that of light, and measurements show that the
increase in mass is in accord with this theory.
</p>
<p>The relativity theory also throws new light on the nature of mass itself. According
to this view, mass and energy are equivalent. The absolute destruction of 1 gram of
any substance, if possible, would yield an amount of energy which is one <span class="pagenum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>hundred million times as much as that obtained by burning the same mass of coal. Conversely,
energy changes are accompanied by changes in mass. The latter are ordinarily so inappreciably
small as to escape our most refined methods of measurements, but in the case of the
radioactive elements we actually observe this phenomenon. From this standpoint, also,
the laws of conservation of energy and of mass are shown to be intimately related.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Universal Relativity</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So far we have dealt with what has been designated as the special theory of relativity.
This, as we have seen, applies to uniform motion only. In extending the theory to
include non-uniform or accelerated motion, Einstein has at the same time deduced a
law of gravitation which is much more general than that of Newton.
</p>
<p>A body falling towards the earth increases in velocity as it falls. The motion is
said to be accelerated. We ascribe this increase in velocity to a gravitational force
exerted by the earth on all objects. As shown by Newton, this force acts between all
particles of matter in the universe, and varies inversely as the square of the distance,
and directly as the product of the masses.
</p>
<p>Of course, we have had a number of theories of gravitation, and none of them have
proven successful. Einstein, however, was the first one to suggest a conception of
gravitation which has proven extremely significant. He points out that a gravitational
force is non-existent for a person falling <span class="pagenum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>freely with the acceleration due to gravity. For this person there is no sensation
of weight, and if he were in a closed box which is also falling with the same acceleration,
he would be unable to decide as to whether his system were falling or situated in
interplanetary space where there is no gravitational field. Furthermore, if he were
to carry out any optical or electrical experiments in this box he would observe the
same results as an experimenter on the earth. A ray of light would travel in a straight
line so far as this observer can perceive, while an external observer would, of course,
judge differently.
</p>
<p>Einstein shows that this is equally true for all kinds of acceleration including that
due to rotation. In the case of a rotating body there exists a centrifugal force which
tends to make objects on the surface fly outwards, but for an external observer this
force does not exist any more than gravity exists for the observer falling freely.
</p>
<p>Thus we can draw the general conclusion that a gravitational field or any other field
of force may be eliminated by choosing an observer moving with the proper acceleration.
For this observer, however, the laws of optics and electricity must be just as valid
as for an observer on the earth.
</p>
<p>In postulating this equivalence hypothesis Einstein merely makes use of the very familiar
observation that, independently of the nature of the material, all bodies possess
the same acceleration in a given field of force.
</p>
<p>The problem which Einstein now sets out to solve is that of determining the law which
shall describe the motion of any system in a field of force in such <span class="pagenum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>a general manner as to leave unaltered the fundamental relations of electricity and
optics.
</p>
<p>In connection with the solution of this problem he finds it necessary to discard the
limitations placed on us by ordinary or Euclidean geometry. In this manner geometrical
concepts as well as those of force are completely robbed of all notions of absoluteness,
and the goal of a general theory of relativity is attained.
</p>
</div>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Geometry of Gravitation</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us consider a circular disc rotating with a uniform peripheral speed. According
to the deductions from the &#x201c;special theory&#x201d; of relativity, an observer situated near
the edge of this disc, but not rotating with it, will observe that units of length
measured along the circumference of the disc are contracted. On the other hand, measurements
along the diameter, which is at right angles to the direction of motion of the circumference,
will show no contraction whatever, and, consequently the observer will find that the
ratio of circumference to diameter has not the well known value 3.14159 &#x2026; but exceeds
this value, the difference being greater and greater as the peripheral speed approaches
that of light. That is, the laws of ordinary geometry no longer hold true.
</p>
<p>However, we know other cases in which the ordinary or Euclidean geometry is not applicable.
Thus suppose that on the surface of a sphere we describe a series of concentric circles.
Since the surface is curved, we are not surprised at finding <span class="pagenum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>that the circumference of any one of these circles is less than 3.14159 &#x2026; times the
distance across the circle as measured on the surface of the sphere. What this means,
therefore, is that we cannot use Euclidean geometry to describe measurements on the
surface of a sphere, and every schoolboy knows this from comparing Mercator&#x2019;s projection
of the earth&#x2019;s surface with the actual representation on a globe.
</p>
<p>When we come to think of it, the reason we realize all this is because our sense of
three dimensions enables us to differentiate flat surfaces from those that are curved.
Let us, however, imagine a two-dimensional being living on the surface of a large
sphere. So long as his measurements are confined to relatively small areas he will
find it possible to describe all his measurements in terms of Euclidean geometry.
As, however, his area of operation increases he will begin to observe greater and
greater discrepancies. Being unfamiliar with the existence of such a three-dimensional
object as a sphere, and therefore not realizing that he is on the surface of one,
our intelligent two-dimensional being will conclude that the disturbance in his geometry
is due to the action of a force, and by means of plausible assumptions on the &#x201c;law&#x201d;
of this force he will reconcile his observations with the laws of plane geometry.
</p>
<p>Now since an acceleration in a gravitational field is identical with that due to centrifugal
force produced by rotation, we concluded that the geometry in a gravitational field
must also be non-Euclidean. That is, space in the neighborhood of matter is <span class="pagenum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>distorted or curved. The curvature of space bears the same relation to three dimensions
that the curvature of a spherical surface bears to two dimensions, and that is why
we do not perceive it, any more than the intelligent two-dimensional being would be
aware of the distortion of his space (or surface). Furthermore, like this being, we
have assumed the existence of a gravitational force to account for discrepancies in
our geometrical measurements.
</p>
<p>The identification in this manner of gravitational effects with geometrical curvature
of space enables Einstein to derive a general law for the path of any particle in
a gravitational field, with respect both to space and to time. Furthermore, the law
expresses this motion in terms which are independent of the relative motion and position
of the observer, and satisfies the condition that the fundamental laws of physics
be equally valid for all observers. The solution of the problem involved the use of
a new kind of higher calculus, elaborated by two Italian mathematicians, Ricci and
Levi-Civita. The result is a law of motion which is extremely general in its validity.
</p>
<p>For low velocities it approximates to Newton&#x2019;s solution, and in the absence of a gravitational
field it leads to the same conclusions as the special theory of relativity. There
are three deductions from this law which have aroused a great deal of interest, and
the confirmation of two of these by actual observation must be regarded as striking
proof of Einstein&#x2019;s theory.

More Strongly and More Successfully Than Usual in a Popular Explanation</span></p>
</div>
<p class="byline">BY HAROLD T. DAVIS, UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN, Madison, Wis.</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the first questions which appears in philosophy is this: What is the great
reality that underlies space and time and the phenomena of the physical universe?
Kant, the philosopher, dismissed it as a subjective problem, affirming that space
and time are &#x201c;a priori&#x201d; concepts beyond which we can say no more.
</p>
<p>Then the world came upon some startling facts. In 1905 a paper appeared by Professor
Albert Einstein which asserted that the explanation of certain remarkable discoveries
in physics gave us a new conception of this strange four-dimensional manifold in which
we live. Thus, the great difference between the space and time of philosophy and the
new knowledge is the objective reality of the latter. It rests upon an <span class="corr" id="xd29e4429" title="Source: amazinging">amazing</span> sequence of physical facts, and the generalized theory, which appeared several years
later, founded as it is upon the abstruse differential calculus of Riemann, Christoffel,
Ricci and Levi-Civita, emerges from its maze of formulas <span class="pagenum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>with the prediction of real phenomena to be sought for the in the world of facts.
</p>
<p>We shall, therefore, approach the subject from this objective point of view. Let us
go to the realm of actual physical events and see how the ideas of relativity gradually
unfolded themselves from the first crude wonderings of science to the stately researches
that first discovered the great ocean of ether and then penetrated in such a marvelous
manner into some of its most mysterious properties.
</p>
<div id="xd29e4435" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Electromagnetic Theory of Light</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Suppose that we go out on a summer night and look into the dark depths of the sky.
A thousand bright specks are flashing there, blue, red, yellow against the dark velvet
of space. And as we look we must all be impressed by the fact that such remote objects
as the stars can be known to us at all. How is it that light, that curious thing which
falls upon the optic nerve and transmits its pictures to the brain, can ever reach
us through the black regions of interstellar space? That is the question which has
for its answer the electromagnetic theory of light.
</p>
<p>The first theory to be advanced was Newton&#x2019;s &#x201c;corpuscular&#x201d; theory which supposed that
the stars are sending off into space little pellets of matter so infinitesimally small
that they can move at the rate of 186,000 miles a second without injuring even so
delicate a thing as the eye when they strike against it.
</p>
<p>But in 1801, when Thomas Young made the very important discovery of interference,
this had to give way to the wave theory, first proposed by Huyghens <span class="pagenum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>in the 17th century. The first great deduction from this, of course, was the &#x201c;luminiferous
ether,&#x201d; because a wave without some medium for its propagation was quite unthinkable.
Certain peculiar properties of the ether were at once evident, since we deduce that
it must fill all space and at the same time be so extremely tenuous that it will not
retard to any noticeable degree the motion through it of material bodies like the
planets.
</p>
<p>But how light was propagated through the ether still remained a perplexing problem
and various theories were proposed, most prominent among them being the &#x201c;elastic solid&#x201d;
theory which tried to ascribe to ether the properties of an elastic body. This theory,
however, laid itself open to serious objection on the ground that no longitudinal
waves had been detected in the ether, so that it began to appear that further insight
into the nature of light had to be sought for in another direction.
</p>
<p>This was soon forthcoming for in 1864 a new theory was proposed by James Clerk Maxwell
which seemed to solve all of the difficulties. Maxwell had been working with the facts
derived from a study of electrical and magnetic phenomena and had shown that electromagnetic
disturbances were propagated through the ether at a velocity identical with that of
light. This, of course, might have been merely a strange coincidence, but Maxwell
went further and demonstrated the interesting fact that an oscillating electric charge
should give rise to a wave that would behave in a manner identical with all of the
known properties of a light wave. One particularly impressive assertion was that these
waves, consisting <span class="pagenum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>of an alternating electric field accompanied by an alternating magnetic field at right
angles to it, and hence called electromagnetic waves, would advance in a direction
perpendicular to the alternating fields. This satisfied the first essential property
of light rays, <i>i.e.</i>, that they must be transverse waves, and the ease with which it explained all of
the fundamental phenomena of optics and predicted a most striking interrelation between
the electrical and optical properties of material bodies, gave it at once a prominent
place among the various theories.
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic theory, however, had to wait until 1888 for verification when
Heinrich Hertz, in a series of brilliant experiments, succeeded in producing electromagnetic
waves in the laboratory and in showing that they possessed all of the properties predicted
by Maxwell. These waves moved with the velocity of light: they could be reflected,
refracted, and polarized: they exhibited the phenomenon of interference and, in short,
could not be distinguished from light waves except for their difference in wave length.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Michelson-Morley Experiment</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With the final establishment of the electromagnetic theory of light as a fact of physics,
we have at last endowed the ether with an actual substantiality. The &#x201c;empty void&#x201d;
is no longer empty, but a great ocean of ether through which the planets and the suns
turn without ever being aware that it is there.
</p>
<p>In 1881 A.&nbsp;A. Michelson undertook an experiment, <span class="pagenum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>originally suggested by Maxwell, to determine the relative motion of our earth to
the ether ocean and six years later he repeated it with the assistance of E.&nbsp;W. Morley.
The experiment is now known as the Michelson-Morley experiment and since it is the
great physical fact upon which the theory of relativity rests, it will be well for
us to examine it in detail.
</p>
<p>Since we can scarcely think that our earth is privileged in the universe and that
it is at rest with respect to this great ether ocean that fills space, we propose
to discover how fast we are actually moving. But the startling fact is that the experiment
devised for this purpose failed to detect any motion whatever of the earth relative
to the ether.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e4464src" href="#xd29e4464">1</a>
</p>
<p>The explanation of this very curious fact was given by both H.&nbsp;A. Lorentz and G.&nbsp;F.
Fitzgerald in what is now widely known under the name of the &#x201c;contraction hypothesis.&#x201d;
It is nothing more nor less than this:
</p>
<p><i>Every solid body undergoes a slight change in <span class="corr" id="xd29e4471" title="Source: dimsensions">dimensions</span>, of the order of</i> (<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f261.1.svg" alt="v squared slash c squared" title="v squared slash c squared" class="f261.1frml"></span>), <i>when it moves with a velocity</i> <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span> <i>through the ether</i>.
</p>
<p>The reason why the experiment failed, then, was not because the earth was not moving
through the ether, but because the instruments with which the experiment was being
conducted had shrunk just enough to negative the effect that was being looked for.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e4487src" href="#xd29e4487">2</a>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Lorentz Transformation</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We can not at this point forebear introducing a little mathematics to further emphasize
the theory and the very logical nature of this contraction hypothesis.
</p>
<p>Let us suppose that we were on a world that was absolutely motionless with respect
to the ether and were looking at a ray of light. The magnetic and electric fields
which form the ray can be described by means of four mathematical expressions which
have come to bear the name of &#x201c;Maxwell&#x2019;s field equations.&#x201d; Now suppose that we ask
ourselves the question: How must these equations be changed so that they will apply
to a ray of light which is being observed by people on a world that is moving with
a velocity v through the ether?
</p>
<p>The answer is immediate. From the Michelson-Morley experiment we know that we can
not tell how fast or how slowly we are moving with respect to the ether. This means
that no matter what world we may be upon, the form of the Maxwell field equations
will always be the same, even though the second set of axes (or frame of reference)
may be moving with high velocity with respect to the first.
</p>
<p>Starting from this hypothesis (called in technical language the covariance of the
equations with respect to a transformation of coordinates), Lorentz found that the
transformation which leaves the field equations unchanged in form was the following:
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f262.1.svg" alt="x prime equals k left-parenthesis x minus v t right-parenthesis comma y prime equals y comma z prime equals z comma t prime equals k left-parenthesis t minus v x slash c right-parenthesis" title="x prime equals k left-parenthesis x minus v t right-parenthesis comma y prime equals y comma z prime equals z comma t prime equals k left-parenthesis t minus v x slash c right-parenthesis" class="f262.1frml"></span>
</p>
<p>where <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>k</i></span> is as on page 92.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span></p>
<p>And what, now, can be deduced from these very simple looking equations? In the first
place we see that the space of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t&#x2032;</i></span> is not our ordinary concept of space at all, but a space in which time is all tangled
up with length. To put it more concretely, we may deduce from them the interesting
fact that whenever an aviator moves with respect to our earth, his shape changes,
and if he were to compare his watch with one on the earth, he would find that his
time had changed also. A sphere would flatten into an ellipse, a meter stick would
shorten up, a watch would slow down and all because, as H. Minkowski has shown us
from these very equations, we are really living in a physical world quite different
from the world of Euclid&#x2019;s geometry in which we are accustomed to think we live.
</p>
<p>A variety of objections has very naturally been made to this rather radical hypothesis
in an attempt to discredit the entire theory, but it is easily seen that any result
obtained through the field equations must necessarily be in conformity with the theory
of contraction, since this theory is only the physical interpretation of that transformation
which leaves the field equations unaltered. Indeed, it is even possible to postulate
the Lorentz transformation together with the assumption that each element of charge
is a center of uniformly diverging tubes of strain and derive the Maxwell field equations
from this, which shows from another point of view the truly fundamental nature of
the transformation.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The First Theory of Relativity</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The whole question of the ether had arrived at <span class="pagenum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>this very interesting point when Professor Einstein in 1905 stated the theory of relativity.
He had noticed that the equations of dynamics as formulated by Newton did not admit
the Lorentz transformation, but only the simple Galilean transformation:
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f264.1.svg" alt="x prime equals x minus v t comma y prime equals y comma z prime equals z semicolon t prime equals t period" title="x prime equals x minus v t comma y prime equals y comma z prime equals z semicolon t prime equals t period" class="f264.1frml"></span>
</p>
<p>Here, indeed, was a curious situation. Two physical principles, that of dynamics and
that of electromagnetism, were coexistent and yet each one admitted a different transformation
when the system of reference was transferred to axes moving with constant velocity
with respect to the ether.
</p>
<p>Now the electromagnetic equations and their transformation had been shown to be in
accord with experimental fact, whereas it had long been felt that Newton&#x2019;s equations
were only a first approximation to the truth. For example, the elliptic orbit of a
planet had been observed by Leverrier to exhibit a disquieting tendency to rotate
in the direction of motion. This precession, which in the case of Mercury was as large
as 43&#x2033; per century, could not be accounted for in any way by the ordinary Newtonian
laws and was, consequently, a very celebrated case of discordance in gravitational
astronomy.
</p>
<p>With this example clearly before him, Einstein took the great step and said that the
laws of dynamics and all other physical laws had to be remade so that they, also,
admit the Lorentz transformation. That is to say,
</p>
<p><i>The laws of physical phenomena, or rather the mathematical expressions for these laws,
are covariant <span class="pagenum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>(unchanged in form) when we apply the Lorentz transformation to them.</i>
</p>
<p>The deductions from the Michelson-Morley experiment now seem to have reached their
ultimate conclusion.
</p>
<p>One discordant fact in this new theory remained, however. That same precession of
the perihelion of Mercury which had first lead Einstein to his theory remained unsettled.
When the new approximations were applied to the formula of orbital motion, a precession
was, indeed, obtained, but the computed value fell considerably below that of the
observed 43&#x2033; per century.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Inclusion of Gravitation</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With the idea of investigating the problem from the very bottom, Einstein now undertook
a broader and more daring point of view. In the first place he said that there is
no apparent reason in the great scheme of world events why any one special system
of coordinates should be fundamental to the description of phenomena, just as in the
special theory a ray of light would appear the same whether viewed from a fixed system
or a system moving with constant velocity with respect to the ether. This makes the
very broad assumption that no matter what system of coordinates we may use, the mathematical
expressions for the laws of nature must be the same. In Einstein&#x2019;s own words, then,
the first principle of this more general theory of relativity must be the following:
</p>
<p>&#x201c;<i>The general laws of nature are expressed <span class="pagenum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>through equations which hold for all systems of coordinates, that is, they are covariant
with respect to arbitrary substitutions.</i>&#x201d;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e4559src" href="#xd29e4559">3</a>
</p>
<p>But this was not enough to include gravitation so Einstein next formulated what he
was pleased to call his &#x201c;equivalence hypothesis.&#x201d; This is best illustrated by an example.
Suppose that we are mounting in an elevator and wish to investigate the world of events
from our moving platform. We mount more and more rapidly, that is with constant acceleration,
and we appear to be in a strong gravitational field due to our own inertia. Suppose,
on the other hand, that the elevator descends with an acceleration equal to that of
gravity. We would now feel certain that we were in empty space because our own relative
acceleration has entirely destroyed that of the earth&#x2019;s gravitational field and all
objects placed upon scales in an elevator would apparently be without weight.
</p>
<p>Applying this idea, then, Einstein decided to do away with gravitation entirely by
referring all events in a gravitational field to a new set of axes which should move
with constant acceleration with respect to the first. In other words we are going
to deal with a system moving with uniform acceleration with respect to the ether,
just as we considered a system moving with uniform velocity in the special theory.
</p>
<p>The next step in the construction of this complicated theory is to reduce these two
hypotheses to the language of mathematics and this was accomplished <span class="pagenum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>by Einstein with the help of M. Grossmann by means of the theory of tensors.
</p>
<p>On account of the very great intricacy of the details, we must content ourselves with
the mere statement that this really involved the generalization of the famous expressions
known as Laplace&#x2019;s and Poisson&#x2019;s equations, on the explicit assumption that these
two equations would still describe the gravitational field when we are content to
use a first approximation to the truth. The set of ten differential equations which
Einstein got as a result of his generalization he called his field equations of gravitation.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e4578src" href="#xd29e4578">4</a>

<p class="line">Of absolute perfection.&#x201d;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Einstein&#x2019;s Theory of Relativity has led to determining a key law of nature&#x2014;the law
of gravitation&#x2014;which is also the basic law of mechanics. Thus it embraces a whole
realm of physics, and promises, through the researches of Professor Weyl, to embrace
another realm&#x2014;electro-dynamics. Its limitations are not yet reached, for Einstein
has already postulated therefrom a theory of a finite, yet unbounded, universe. This
essay, however, is mainly concerned with mechanics, and electrical forces are not
considered.
</p>
<p>To have synthesised Newton&#x2019;s two great principles&#x2014;his law of motion and law of gravitation&#x2014;interpreting
in the process the empirical law of equality of gravitational and inertial mass, is
alone an immense achievement; but Einstein&#x2019;s researches have opened up a new world
to the physicist and <span class="pagenum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>philosopher which is of greater importance. He has given us a vision of the immaterial
world, a geometrical or mathematical vision, which is more satisfying than the &#x201c;ether&#x201d;
conceptions hitherto presented. The fabric of his vision is not baseless. It is this
fabric we shall consider, touching on certain aspects of the Einstein theory in the
endeavor to present an image in miniature of his edifice of thought and to show the
firmness of its foundations. That they are well and truly laid was demonstrated by
the verification, from observations made during the solar eclipse in 1919, of Einstein&#x2019;s
prediction of the displacement of a wave of light in a gravitational field, showing
light to have the property of weight.
</p>
<p>The physical world is shown by Einstein to be a world of &#x201c;relations.&#x201d; Underlying it
there is an absolute world of which physical phenomena are the manifestation. &#x201c;Give
me matter and motion,&#x201d; says Descartes, &#x201c;and I will construct the world.&#x201d; &#x201c;Give me
a world in which there are ordered relations,&#x201d; says the Relativist, &#x201c;and I will show
you the behavior of matter therein&#x201d; (mechanics). We first view this underlying world
as an abstraction, abstracting energy (&#x201c;bound&#x201d; as in matter and electrons, &#x201c;free&#x201d;
as in light), and its attribute force. This abstraction we will call the &#x201c;World-Frame.&#x201d;
Later, we will study the underlying world in connection with energy, and will call
this absolute world the &#x201c;World-Fabric.&#x201d; The connection between the geometrical character
of the World-Frame and the geometrical characters of the World-Fabric is the key to
the law of gravitation.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<div id="xd29e4606" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The World-Frame</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is our conception of a world, if such were possible, entirely free from the influence
of energy. We may conceive of it as an amorphous immaterial something containing &#x201c;point-events&#x201d;
(a point-event being an instant of time at a point in space&#x2014;a conception, not a definition).
These point-events have a fourfold order and definite relation in this Frame, <i>i.e.</i> they can be specified by four variables or coordinates in reference to some base
called a reference system, with respect to which they are forward or backward, right
or left, above or below, <i>sooner or later</i>. This shows the World-Frame to be four-dimensional. Thus an aggregate of point-events
(or an &#x201c;event,&#x201d; which implies limited extension in space and limited duration in time)<a class="noteref" id="xd29e4616src" href="#xd29e4616">1</a> would have what we familiarly describe as length, breadth, height and time. To express
these metrical properties most simply we must choose a four-dimensional reference
system having a particular form&#x2014;rectilinear axes (Cartesian coordinates), and a particular
motion&#x2014;uniform and rectilinear, <i>i.e.</i> unaccelerated, and non-rotating with respect to the path of a light ray. We call
this an inertial system <span class="pagenum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>because Newton&#x2019;s Law of Inertia holds for such a system alone. This system indicates
how observers partition the World-Frame into space and time. It restricts observers
to uniform rectilinear motion, and observations to bodies and light-pulses in such
motion. Thus gravitational and other forces are discounted, and we obtain World-Frame
conditions notwithstanding the fact that <span class="corr" id="xd29e4624" title="Source: oberservers">observers</span> are in the presence of energy.
</p>
<p>Now the separation between point-events which have a definite relation to each other
must be <i>absolute</i>. The separation between two points in a plane is defined by the unique distance between
them (the straight line joining them). Between point-events the analogue of this unique
distance, which we call the &#x201c;separation-interval&#x201d; (to indicate its time-like and space-like
nature), is also unique. Its unique and absolute character give it great importance
as thereby it is the same for all observers regardless of their reference system.
</p>
<p>If, in place of the rather cumbersome expression <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f201.1.svg" alt="upper X minus x" title="upper X minus x" class="f201.1frml"></span> to indicate the difference between the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>-coordinates of two points, we employ the more compact expression <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>dx</i></span>; if for the benefit of readers who have a little algebra but no analysis we state
explicitly that this expression is a single symbol for a single quantity, and has
nothing to do with any product of two quantities <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>d</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>; and if we extend this notation to all our coordinates: then it is clear from previous
essays that the distance <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> between two points in a plane referred to a rectilinear system <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OX</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OY</i></span>, is given by the simple equation <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f271.8.svg" alt="upper S squared equals left-parenthesis d x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d y right-parenthesis squared" title="upper S squared equals left-parenthesis d x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d y right-parenthesis squared" class="f271.8frml"></span>. Einstein and Minkowski show <span class="pagenum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>that the value for the separation interval <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f272.1.svg" alt="normal upper Omega" title="normal upper Omega" class="f272.1frml"></span>, the analogue of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span>, referred to an inertial system is given by the equation
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f272.3.svg" alt="normal upper Omega squared equals left-parenthesis d x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d z right-parenthesis squared minus left-parenthesis d t right-parenthesis squared comma" title="normal upper Omega squared equals left-parenthesis d x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d z right-parenthesis squared minus left-parenthesis d t right-parenthesis squared comma" class="f272.3frml"></span>
</p>
<p>which is seen to be a modified extension to four dimensions of the equation for <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span>. We must measure <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span> in the same units as <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>z</i></span>. By taking the constant velocity of light (300,000 kilometres per second) as unit
velocity, we can measure in length or time indiscriminately.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e4691src" href="#xd29e4691">2</a>
</p>
<p>We will analyse briefly this equation as it epitomizes the Special Theory of Relativity.
If the World-Frame had been Euclidean the equation would have been
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f272.9.svg" alt="normal upper Omega squared equals left-parenthesis d x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d z right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d t right-parenthesis squared" title="normal upper Omega squared equals left-parenthesis d x right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d y right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d z right-parenthesis squared plus left-parenthesis d t right-parenthesis squared" class="f272.9frml"></span>
</p>
<p>but this would not satisfy the &#x201c;transformation equations&#x201d; which resulted from the
Special Theory. These transformation equations arose directly from a reconciliation
between two observed facts; (a) the observed <i>agreement</i> of <i>all</i> natural phenomena with the &#x201c;Restricted Principle of Relativity&#x201d;&#x2014;a principle which
shows that absolute rectilinear motion cannot be established&#x2014;(as regards mechanics
this was recognized by Newton; the Michelson-Morley and other experiments showed this
principle also applied <span class="pagenum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>to optical and electro-dynamical phenomena); and (b) the observed <i>disagreement</i> of optical and electro-dynamical phenomena (notably the constancy of light velocity)
with the laws of dynamics as given by classical mechanics, <i>e.g.</i>, in regard to the compounding of relative velocities. Einstein effected this reconciliation
by detecting a flaw in classical mechanics. He showed that by regarding space and
time measurements as relative to the observer&#x2014;not absolute as Newton defined them&#x2014;there
was nothing incompatible between the Principle of Relativity and the laws of dynamics
so modified. Newton&#x2019;s definitions were founded on conception. Einstein&#x2019;s recognition
of the relativity of space and time is based on observation.
</p>
<p>Equation (1) shows that the geometry of the World-Frame referred to an inertial system
is semi-Euclidean (hyperbolic), and that space and time measurements are relative
to the observer&#x2019;s inertial reference system. The equation shows that the World-Frame
has a certain geometrical character which we distinguish as four-dimensional &#x201c;flatness.&#x201d;
It is everywhere alike (homaloidal). Its flat character is shown by the straight line
nature of the separation-interval and of the system to which it is most simply referred.
</p>
<p>Thus we have found two absolute features in the World-Frame&#x2014;(1) Its geometrical character&#x2014;&#x201d;<i>flatness</i>&#x201d;; (2) The <i>separation-interval</i>&#x2014;which can be expressed in terms of measurable variables called space and time partitions,
this partitioning being dependent on the observer&#x2019;s motion.
</p>
<p>We are now in a position to explore the World-Fabric. <span class="pagenum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>Already we see that, studied under inertial conditions (free of force), it agrees
with the World-Frame.

World-Fabric. Consider the World-Frame to be disturbed. We may regard this disturbance,
which manifests itself in physical phenomena, as energy, or more correctly &#x201c;action.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>When energy is thwarted in its natural flow, force is manifested, with which are associated
non-uniform motions such as accelerations and rotations. This disturbed World-Frame
we distinguish as the World-Fabric. It is found to have various non-Euclidean characters
differing from the simple &#x201c;flat&#x201d; character of the World-Frame according to the degree
of disturbance (action) in the region. Disturbance gives the fabric a geometrical
character of &#x201c;curvature&#x201d;; the more considerable the disturbance, the greater the curvature.
Thus an empty region (not containing energy, but under its influence) has less curvature
than a region in which free energy abounds.
</p>
<p>Our problem, after showing the relativity of force (especially gravitational force),
is to determine the law underlying the fabric&#x2019;s geometrical character; to ascertain
how the degree of curvature is related to the energy influencing a region, and how
the curvature of one region is linked by differential equations to that of neighboring
regions. Such a law will be seen to be the law of gravitation.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span></p>
<p>We study the World-Fabric by considering tracks on which material particles and light-pulses
progress; we find such tracks regulated and defined by the Fabric&#x2019;s curvature, and
not, as hitherto supposed, by attractive force inherent in matter. As a track is measurable
by summing the separation-intervals between near-by point-events on it, all observers
will agree which is the unique track between two distant point-events. Einstein postulates
that freely progressing bodies will follow unique tracks, which are therefore called
natural tracks (geodesics).
</p>
<p>If material bodies are prevented from following natural tracks by contact with matter
or other causes, the phenomenon of gravitational force is manifested relative to them.
Whenever the natural flow of energy is interrupted force is born. For example, when
the piston interrupts the flow of steam, or golf ball flow of club, force results&#x2014;the
interruption is mutual, and the force relative to both. Likewise when the earth interrupts
the natural track of a particle (or observer) gravitational force is manifested relative
to both.
</p>
<p>So long as a body moves freely no force is appreciated by it. A falling aviator (neglecting
air resistance) will not appreciate any gravitational force. He follows a natural
track, thereby freeing himself from the force experienced in contact with matter.
He acquires an accelerating motion with respect to an inertial system. By acquiring
a particular accelerating motion an observer can annul <i>any</i> force experienced in any small region where the field of force can be considered
constant.
</p>
<p>Thus Einstein, interpreting the equality of gravitational <span class="pagenum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>and inertial mass, showed that the same quality manifests itself according to circumstances
as &#x201c;weight&#x201d; or as inertia, and that all force is purely relative and may be treated
as one phenomenon (an interruption in energy flow). This &#x201c;Principle of Equivalence&#x201d;
shows that small portions of the World-Fabric, observed from a freely moving particle
(free of force), could be treated as small portions of the World-Frame.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e4743src" href="#xd29e4743">3</a>
</p>
<p>If such observations were practicable, we could determine the Fabric curvature by
referring point-event measurements to equation (1). We cannot observe from unique
tracks but we can observe them from our restrained situation. Their importance is
now apparent, because, by tracing them over a region, we are tracing something absolute
in the Fabric&#x2014;its geometrical character. We study this curvature by exploring separation-intervals
on the tracks of freely moving bodies, relating these separation-intervals to actual
measurements in terms of space and time components depending on the observer&#x2019;s reference
system. The law of curvature must be the law of gravitation. To illustrate the lines
on which Einstein proceeded to survey the World-Fabric from the earth we will consider
a similar but more simple problem&#x2014;the survey of the sea-surface curvature from an
airship. We study this curvature by exploring small distances on the tracks of ships
(which we must suppose can only move uniformly <span class="pagenum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>on unique tracks&#x2014;arcs of great circles), relating such distances to actual measurements
in terms of length and breadth components depending on the observer&#x2019;s reference system.
This two-dimensional surface problem can be extended to the four-dimensional Fabric
one.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus we approach the absolute character of the surface through the relative nature
of the observer&#x2019;s reference system. There is a relationship common to all values of
the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>g</i></span>&#x2019;s that belong to the same <span class="pagenum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>curvature. This relationship is expressed by a differential equation. It is this equation
of curvature that the airship&#x2019;s observer must find. Einstein&#x2019;s problem was similar,
but he was concerned with four dimensions, which entailed a general formula with ten
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>g</i></span>&#x2019;s, and he had to find a set of differential equations of the second order to determine
the law of Fabric curvature. He divided the Fabric into regions: I. World-Frame&#x2014;beyond
influence of energy. II. Empty region&#x2014;free of energy, but under its influence. III.
Region containing free energy only. Each region has a characteristic curvature. By
means of an absolute differential calculus&#x2014;a wonderful mathematical scaffolding erected
by Riemann, Christoffel and others&#x2014;involving the theory of tensors, he succeeded in
finding such a set of equations. He kept the following points in view: (1) The equations
must not only give the character of region II, but must satisfy the special case of
region I; (2) They must be independent of any partitioning system, because the General
Theory <span class="corr" id="xd29e4852" title="Source: or">of</span> Relativity demands that a law of nature be in a form appropriate for all observers
whatever their position and motion; (3) They must be concerned with energy which is
conserved, not mass which the Special Theory showed dependent on velocity. This set
of differential equations which shows how the curvature of the Fabric at any point
links to the curvature at neighboring points is the law of gravitation, a law which
has been severely tested by the practical observation of the solar eclipse already
referred to. At a first approximation these equations degenerate into Newton&#x2019;s Law.
At a second <span class="pagenum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>approximation they account for the motion of the perihelion of Mercury, which had
hitherto baffled astronomers. All the laws of mechanics are deducible from this law
of World-Fabric curvature, <i>i.e.</i> conservation of energy (which includes conservation of mass since we re-define mass
as energy) and conservation of momentum (re-defined by a relativist). It must be noted
that this law and the General Theory show that the velocity of light is not absolutely
constant, but, like everything else, a light-pulse is affected by the Fabric curvature
in a gravitational field. In conclusion we will contrast some conspicuous differences
in the old world view of classical mechanics and the new view presented by Einstein.
</p>
<p>1. A three-dimensional ether medium with variously conceived properties which communicated
the supposed inherent attractive force in matter in some unexplained way, and transmitted
electromagnetic waves, has been replaced by a four-dimensional external World-Fabric,
the geometrical character of which controls the motion of matter (energy) and accounts
for all mechanical laws.
</p>
<p>2. After separating the observer&#x2019;s subjective share in definitions from nature&#x2019;s share
in the things defined, space, time, and force, hitherto regarded as absolute, have
been shown to be purely relative and dependent on the observer&#x2019;s track. Mass has also
proved to be relative to velocity unless re-defined as energy. As classical mechanics
bases all definitions on space, time, and mass units, the relativity of such defined
quantities is now apparent.
</p>
<p>3. Newton&#x2019;s laws of motion, his law of gravitation, <span class="pagenum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>and the laws of conservation, hitherto regarded as unrelated, are now synthesised
in a basic law of mechanics.
</p>
<p>Einstein has not disturbed the electric theory of matter, and both the old and new
physics have in common the &#x201c;Principle of Least Action.&#x201d; We obtain a glimpse of this
principle in the unique tracks pursued by freely moving bodies, which may be regarded
as tracks of least effort, force only being manifested as an expression of the Fabric&#x2019;s
resentment when bodies depart from these natural tracks. Einstein has approached nearer
to the truth in regard to the laws underlying nature, and, as always, this means a
simplification. His theory, which entails a readjustment of such fundamental conceptions
as space and time, opens up fresh fields to scientific investigation and to philosophic
thought. It reveals a bridge uniting the domains of physics and philosophy, and it
heralds a new era in the history of science.

of the latter sort, occupying an appreciable region of space rather than a single

</div>
<p class="byline">BY GEORGE FREDERICK HEMENS, M.C., B.SC., LONDON</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is familiar knowledge that the line, the surface and ordinary Euclidean space are
to be regarded as spaces of one, two and three dimensions respectively and readers
of this journal are aware that a hypothetical space of four dimensions has been closely
investigated. The most convenient space to study is the surface or two-space, since
we can regard it as embedded in a three-space. If a surface is curved it is generally
impossible to draw a straight line on it, for as we see clearly, the &#x201c;straightest&#x201d;
line is changing its direction at every point. To describe this property accurately
it is necessary to ascribe to each point a magnitude which expresses what happens
to the direction of a short line in the region when displaced a short distance parallel
to itself. This is called <i>the direction-defining magnitude</i>. Different sets of values of this magnitude relate to surfaces of different curvatures.
</p>
<p>A second fundamental property has recently been pointed out. There is inherent in
every part of a space a measure of length peculiar to that particular <span class="pagenum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>region and which in general varies from region to region. To describe this variation
accurately it is necessary to ascribe to each point another magnitude called <i>the length-defining magnitude</i>, which expresses the change from each point to the next of the unit of length. These
two magnitudes define the surface completely.
</p>
<p>Similarly, a space of any number of dimensions is defined completely by a similar
pair of magnitudes. A space is the &#x201c;field&#x201d; of such a magnitude-pair and the nature
of these magnitudes defines the dimensions of the space. The four-space usually described
is the Euclidean member of an infinity of four-spaces.
</p>
<p>When we look into a mirror we see a space differing from ordinary space in that right
and left are interchanged and this is described mathematically by saying that if we
locate points as usual by specifying three distances <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.1.svg" alt="upper X 1" title="upper X 1" class="f283.1frml"></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.2.svg" alt="upper X 2" title="upper X 2" class="f283.2frml"></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.3.svg" alt="upper X 3" title="upper X 3" class="f283.3frml"></span> of the point from three mutually perpendicular planes, then a point <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.1.svg" alt="upper X 1" title="upper X 1" class="f283.1frml"></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.2.svg" alt="upper X 2" title="upper X 2" class="f283.2frml"></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.3.svg" alt="upper X 3" title="upper X 3" class="f283.3frml"></span>, in actual space corresponds with a point <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.1.svg" alt="upper X 1" title="upper X 1" class="f283.1frml"></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.2.svg" alt="upper X 2" title="upper X 2" class="f283.2frml"></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.9.svg" alt="minus upper X 3" title="minus upper X 3" class="f283.9frml"></span> in the mirrored space: in other words the mirrored space is derived from the real
space by multiplying the <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.3.svg" alt="upper X 3" title="upper X 3" class="f283.3frml"></span> coordinates by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.11.svg" alt="negative 1" title="negative 1" class="f283.11frml"></span>. If we were to multiply by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.12.svg" alt="StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot" title="StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot" class="f283.12frml"></span> instead of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.11.svg" alt="negative 1" title="negative 1" class="f283.11frml"></span> we should derive a different space; in this case, however, we have no mirror to show
us what it looks like. Such a space is said to have one negative dimension and it
has the peculiar property that in the figure derived from the right triangle of ordinary
space the square of the &#x201c;hypotenuse&#x201d; equals the difference and not the sum of the
squares of the other two sides, so that the length of a line may sometimes have to
be represented by the square-root <span class="pagenum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>of a negative number, a &#x201c;complex&#x201d; number.
</p>
<p>In considering what at first sight may appear to be fantastic statements made by this
theory, it must be borne in mind that all our knowledge of the external universe comes
through our sense-impressions, and our most confident statements about external things
are really of the nature of inferences from these sense-impressions and, being inferences,
liable to be wrong. So that if the theory says that a stone lying on the ground is
not a simple three-dimensional object, and that its substance is not the same as its
substance a moment before, the matter is one for due consideration and not immediate
disbelief.
</p>
<p>The idea that the universe extends in time as well as in space is not new, and fiction-writers
have familiarized us with wonderful machines in which travellers journey in time and
are present at various stages of the world&#x2019;s history. This conception of the universe,
to which the name &#x201c;space-time&#x201d; is usually applied, is adopted by the new theory and
assigned the status of a physical reality.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The World Geometry</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The fundamental creed of the new theory is that the space-time universe constitutes
a true four-dimensional space of one negative dimension, this dimension being <i>time</i>. The variations from point to point of the direction-defining and length-defining
magnitudes generate the geometrical properties of curvature, etc., and these are cognised
by the human mind as physical phenomena: our sense-impressions are nothing more nor
less than perceptions of the <span class="pagenum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>geometry of a fourspace. So instead of inferring from our sense-impressions the existence
of matter, motion and the like as we are accustomed to do, we should with equal justice
infer the existence of a geometrical fourspace. Thus it becomes necessary to prepare
a dictionary in which the familiar things of our world are identified with those geometrical
properties of the four-space which really constitute them, and in so doing parts of
our geometrical knowledge assume the guise of new physical knowledge.
</p>
<p>Through the fourspace our consciousness travels, cognising a changing three-dimensional
section of it as it goes and thus giving rise to <i>time</i>. It becomes aware that the fourspace is pleated or folded along lines all running
roughly in the same direction, and possibly because this is the easiest direction
to follow, it travels along the lines. The direction of this motion is the negative
dimension. Thus consciousness is always aware of the nearly constant forms of the
cross-sections of the pleats along which it travels. These unvarying forms constitute
matter: matter is the form of a section through a uniform pleat of the fourspace&#x2014;a
three-dimensional aspect of a four-dimensional curvature; so that in strict accuracy
we should say that a stone is the shape or form of a changing section of a four-dimensional
object, the complete object being a long fold in the fourspace. The physical interpretation
of this conservation of form of the cross-section is that matter is conserved. It
is thus seen that the conscious mind, by following these pleats, has so determined
time that the law of the conservation of matter must hold. The mathematical treatment
of the <span class="pagenum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>subject makes it clear that practically all other physical laws similarly follow as
a direct result of this choice of time. The type of order prevailing in the physical
universe, the laws of gravitation, heat, motion and the rest are <i>not</i> directly imposed by some external power, but are apparently chosen by mind itself.
</p>
<p>In the neighborhood of these pleats the fourspace is still curved, but to a smaller
degree. This we cognise as energy or as a field of force. Thus energy is seen to be
the same kind of thing as matter and would therefore be expected to have weight. This
was experimentally demonstrated in 1919 when light was in effect actually weighed.
Conversely, matter consists of energy; and it is calculated that one liter of water
contains sufficient energy to develop a million horsepower for about four years. It
is now believed that the sun&#x2019;s energy is derived from the disintegration of the matter
of which it is made.
</p>
<p>The method of establishing these identifications will be clear from the following:
We already knew that matter is made up of electrons and that radiant energy is electromagnetic
and before the advent of this theory it was regarded as certain that practically all
observed physical phenomena except gravitation were manifestations of the electromagnetic
field. The new theory has confirmed this belief. It is found that the gravitational
and electromagnetic conditions of the universe are completely defined if to each point
of space-time a gravitational and an electric potential are ascribed. These are magnitudes
of the same nature as the direction-defining and length-defining magnitudes which
must necessarily be <span class="pagenum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>associated with every point of space-time if it is a true &#x201c;space,&#x201d; and they are therefore
identified with these. By performing ordinary mathematical operations on these magnitudes
statements of fact clothed in mathematical form are obtained, which are to be interpreted
on the one hand as physical laws and on the other as geometrical properties of the
fourspace. Nearly all our physical laws are derivable mathematically in this way,
so that an extensive identification is effected which has been fruitful of results.
</p>
<p>It has been mentioned that a slight curvature is sometimes cognised as force and as
this identification appeared originally as a postulate its history is interesting.

<p class="first">An experiment by Michelson and Morley (1887), on which the whole theory is based,
made it appear that if a man measures the velocity at which light passes him he will
get the same result whether he is stationary, rushing to meet the light, or moving
in the same direction as the light. The solution was provided by Einstein in 1905.
He suggested that since we know the results of these determinations ought not to agree,
something must have happened to the clocks and measuring-rods used in measuring the
velocity so that the standards of length and time were not the same in the three cases,
the alterations being exactly such as to make the velocity of light constant. This
solution is universally accepted as true and is the fundamental postulate. Thus the
length of a stick and the rate at which time passes <span class="pagenum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>will change as the velocity of the person observing these things changes. If a man
measured the length of an aeroplane going past him at 161,000 miles per second it
would measure only half the length observed when stationary. If the aeroplane were
going with the velocity of light, its length would vanish though its breadth and height
would be unaltered. Similarly, if of two twin brothers one were continually moving
with reference to the other their ages would gradually diverge, for time would go
at different rates for the two. If one moved with the velocity of light, time would
stand still for him while for the other it would go on as usual. To get actually younger
it would be necessary to move quicker than light which is believed to be impossible.
The velocity of light is assumed to be the greatest velocity occurring in nature.
</p>
<p>Evidently then if the distance in space and the interval in time separating two given
events, such as the firing of a gun and the bursting of the shell, are measured by
two observers in uniform relative motion, their estimates will not agree. Consider
now the simple problem of measuring the distance between two points on an ordinary
drawing-board. If we draw two perpendicular axes, we can define this distance by specifying
the lengths of the projections on the two axes of the line joining the points. If
we choose two different axes the projections will not be the same but will define
the same length. Similarly, in a Euclidean four-space the distance between two points
will be defined by the projections on the four axes, but if these axes be rotated
slightly, the projections will be different, but <span class="pagenum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>will define the same length. Now, returning to the two observers just mentioned, it
was noticed by Minkowski in 1908 that if the space measurements between the two events
are split into the usual three components, and if the time measurements are multiplied
by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f283.12.svg" alt="StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot" title="StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot" class="f283.12frml"></span>, the difference between the two sets of measurements is exactly the same as would
have occurred had these two events been points in a Euclidean fourspace, and two different
observations made of their distance apart using two sets of axes inclined to each
other. The velocity of light is made equal to 1 in this calculation by a suitable
choice of units. This discovery threw a vivid light on the problem of space-time,
showing that it is probably a true four-space of one negative dimension, a simple
derivative of the much-discussed and now familiar Euclidean four-space.
</p>
<p>Although this discovery gave a tremendous impetus to the progress of the theory, it
is probable that it holds a deeper significance not yet revealed. It is probably a
statement of the &#x201c;stuff&#x201d; of which the four-space is made, and perhaps also of how
it is made; but the problem remains unsolved.
</p>
<p>It thus becomes plain that our two observers are merely looking at the same thing
from different viewpoints. Each has just as much right as the other to regard himself
as being at rest in ordinary space (this is the postulate of the relativity of uniform
motion) and to regard his time direction as a straight line in the four-space. The
difference is merely that the two time axes are inclined to each other. If, however,
one were moving with an acceleration with reference to the other his path in the four-space
<span class="pagenum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>will appear curved to the other, though he himself, since he regards it as his time
axis, will still assume it to be straight. If there is a body moving in what one observer
sees to be a straight line, the other will, of course, in general see it as curved,
and following the usual custom, since this body, without apparent reason, deviates
from the straight path, will say there must be some force acting on it. Thus the curvature
of his time axis, due to his accelerated motion, makes it appear that there is round
him a field of force, which causes freely moving bodies to deviate from the straight
path. Now if space-time is itself inherently curved it is not generally possible for
any line in it to be straight any more than it is possible for any line on the surface
of a sphere to be straight. Hence, all axes must be curved, and all observers, whatever
their states of motion, must experience fields of force which are of the same nature
as those due to motion only. The extra force experienced when a lift begins to rise
is an example of force due to pure motion: gravitation is the similar force due to
an inherent curvature of the four-space, and it was the postulate that these forces
were similar that made possible Einstein&#x2019;s solution of the general problem of gravitation.

region, but not in any other, which agrees with experience and shows that the theory
is <i>not essentially &#x201c;determinist.&#x201d;</i> If &#x201c;free-will&#x201d; is really free, the future is not yet determined, and the fourspace
must be in some way formed by the will as time progresses.

<p>The trains of thought inspired by Einstein&#x2019;s postulates have already carried us to
a pinnacle of knowledge unprecedented in the history of man. On every hand, as we
look out upon the universe from our new and lofty standpoint, unexpected and enthralling
vistas open up before us, and we find ourselves confronting nature with an insight
such as no man has ever before dared aspire to.
</p>
<p>It is completely unthinkable that this theory can ever be swept aside. Apart from
experimental verifications which, in point of fact, lend it the strongest support,
no one could work through the theory without feeling that here, in truth, the inner
workings of the universe were laid bare before him. The harmony with nature is far
too complete for any doubt to arise of its truth.

</div>
<p class="byline">BY DR. FRANCIS D. MURNAGHAN,<br>
JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br>
BALTIMORE</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We shall discuss the more important aspects of the theory popularly known as the &#x201c;Einstein
Theory of Gravitation&#x201d; and shall try to show clearly that this theory is a natural
outcome of ideas long held by physicists in general. These ideas are:
</p>
<p>(a) The impossibility of &#x201c;action at a distance;&#x201d; in other words we find an instinctive
repugnance to admit that one body can affect another, remote from it, instantaneously
and without the existence of an intervening medium.
</p>
<p>(b) The independence of natural, <i>i.e.</i>, physical, laws of their mathematical mode of expression. Thus, when an equation
is written down as the expression of a physical law it must be satisfied, no matter
what units we choose in order to measure the quantities occurring in the equation.
As our physics teacher used to say &#x201c;the expression of the law must have in every term
<i>the same dimensions</i>.&#x201d; <span class="pagenum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>More than this the choice of the quantities used to express the law&#x2014;if there be a
choice open&#x2014;must have no effect on its correctness. As we were told&#x2014;&#x201c;all physical
laws are capable of expression as relations between vectors or else as relations between
magnitudes of the same dimensions.&#x201d; We shall hope to make this clearer in its proper
place in the essay, as its obvious generalization is Einstein&#x2019;s cardinal principle
of relativity.
</p>
<p>The measurements which an experimental physicist makes are always the expression of
a coincidence of two points in space at the same time. If we ask such an experimenter
what he means by a <i>point in space</i> he tells us that, for him, the term has no meaning until he has a material body with
reference to which he can locate the point by measurements; in general it requires
<i>three</i> measurements and he expresses this by saying that space has <i>three</i> dimensions. He measures his distance, as a rule, parallel to three mutually perpendicular
lines fixed in the material body&#x2014;a Cartesian reference-frame so-called. So that a
&#x201c;point in space&#x201d; is equivalent to a given material reference-frame and three numbers
or <i>coordinates</i>. If, for any reason, we prefer to use a new material reference-frame the coordinates
or measurements will change and, if we know the relative positions of the two material
reference-frames, there is a definite relation between the two sets of three coordinates
which is termed a transformation of coordinates. But which particular material reference-frame
shall we use? The first choice would, we think, be that attached to the earth. But,
even yet, we are in doubt as there are numberless Cartesian <span class="pagenum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>frameworks attached to the earth (as to any material body) and it is here that our
idea (b) begins to function. We say it must be immaterial which of these Cartesian
frames we use. In each frame a <i>vector</i> has three components and when we change from one frame to another the components
change in such a way that if two vectors have their three components equal in one
framework they will be equal in any other attached to the <i>same</i> material system. So our idea (b), which says that our physical equations must be
vector equations, is equivalent to saying that the choice of the framework attached
to any given material body can have no effect on the mode of expression of a natural
law.
</p>
<p>Shall we carry over our idea (b) to answer the next question: &#x201c;To which material body
shall we attach our framework?&#x201d; To this question Newton gave one answer and Einstein
another. We shall first consider Newton&#x2019;s position and then we may hope to see clearly
where the new theory diverges from the <i>classical</i> or <i>Newtonian</i> mechanics. Newton&#x2019;s answer was that there is a particular material frame with reference
to which the laws of mechanics have a remarkably simple form commonly known as &#x201c;Newton&#x2019;s
laws of motion&#x201d; and so it is preferable to use this framework which is called an <i>absolute</i> frame.
</p>
<p>What is the essential peculiarity of an absolute frame? Newton was essentially an
empiricist of Bacon&#x2019;s school and he observed the following facts. Let us suppose we
have a framework of reference attached to the <i>earth</i>. Then a small particle of matter under the gravitational influence of surrounding
<span class="pagenum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>bodies, including the earth, takes on a certain acceleration <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f296.1.svg" alt="upper A 1" title="upper A 1" class="f296.1frml"></span>. Now suppose the surrounding bodies removed (since we cannot remove the earth we
shall have to view the experiment as an abstraction), and another set introduced;
the particle, being again at its original position, will begin to move with an acceleration
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f296.3.svg" alt="upper A 2" title="upper A 2" class="f296.3frml"></span>. If both sets of surrounding bodies are present simultaneously the particle begins
to move with an acceleration which is <i>approximately but not quite</i> the sum of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f296.1.svg" alt="upper A 1" title="upper A 1" class="f296.1frml"></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f296.3.svg" alt="upper A 2" title="upper A 2" class="f296.3frml"></span>. Newton postulated there there is a certain absolute reference frame in which the
approximation would be an equality; and so the acceleration, relative to the material
frame, furnishes a convenient measure of the effect of the surrounding bodies&#x2014;which
effect we call their <i>gravitational force</i>. Notice that if the effect of the surrounding bodies is small the acceleration is
small and so we obtain as a limiting case, <i>Newton&#x2019;s law of inertia</i> which says that a body subject to no forces has no acceleration; a law which, as
<span class="corr" id="xd29e5102" title="Source: Poincairé">Poincaré</span> justly observed, can never be subjected to experimental justification. The natural
questions then arise: which is the absolute and privileged reference-frame and how
must the simple laws be modified when we use a frame more convenient for us&#x2014;one attached
to the earth let us say? The absolute frame is one attached to the fixed stars; and
to the absolute or real force defined as above, we must add certain terms, usually
called centrifugal forces. These are referred to as <i>fictitious</i> forces because, as it is explained, they are due to the motion of the reference-frame
with respect to the absolute frame and in no way depend on the distribution of the
<span class="pagenum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>surrounding bodies. Gravitational force and centrifugal forces have in common the
remarkable property that they depend in no way on the material of the attracted body
nor on its chemical state; they act on all matter and are in this way different from
other forces met with in nature, such as magnetic or electric forces. Further Newton
found that he could predict the facts of observation accurately on the hypothesis
that two small particles of matter attracted each other, in the direction of the line
joining them, with a force varying inversely as the square of the distance between
them. This law is an &#x201c;action at a distance&#x201d; law and so is opposed to the idea (a).
</p>
<p>We have tacitly supposed that the space in which we make our measurements is that
made familiar to us by the study of Euclid&#x2019;s elements. The characteristic property
of this space is that stated by the theorem of Pythagoras that the distance between
two points is found by extracting the square root of the sum of the squares of the
differences of the Cartesian coordinates of the two points. Mathematicians have long
recognized the possibility of other types of space and Einstein has followed their
lead. He <i>abandons the empiricist method</i> and when asked what he means by a point in space replies that to him a point in space
is equivalent to four numbers <i>how obtained it is unnecessary to know a priori</i>; in certain special cases they may be the three Cartesian coordinates of the experimenter
(measured with reference to a definite material framework) together with the time.
Accordingly he says his <i>space is of four dimensions</i>. Between any two <span class="pagenum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>&#x201c;points&#x201d; we may insert a sequence of sets of four numbers, varying continuously from
the first set to the second, thus forming what we call a curve joining the two points.
Now we define the &#x201c;length&#x201d; of this curve in a manner which involves all the points
on it and stipulate that this length has a physical reality, <i>i.e.</i>, according to our idea (b) its value is independent of the particular choice of coordinates
we make in describing the space. Among all the joining curves there will be one with
the property of having the smallest length; this is called a <i>geodesic</i> and corresponds to the straight line in Euclidean space. We must now, for lack of
an <i>a priori</i> description of the actual significance of our coordinates, extend the idea of vector
so that we may speak of the components of a vector no matter what our coordinates
may actually signify. In this way are introduced what are known as <i>tensors</i>; if two tensors are equal, <i>i.e.</i>, have all their components equal, in any one set of coordinates they are equal in
any other and the fundamental demand of the new physics is that <i>all physical equations which are not merely the expression of equality of magnitudes
must state the equality of tensors</i>. In this way no one system of coordinates is privileged above any other and the laws
of physics are expressed in a form independent of the actual coordinates chosen; they
are written, as we may say, in an absolute form.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Gravitational Hypothesis</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Einstein flatly denies Newton&#x2019;s hypothesis that there is an absolute system (and,
indeed, many others <span class="pagenum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>before him had found it difficult to admit that so insignificant a part of the universe
as our fixed star system should have such a privileged position as that accorded to
it in the Newtonian Mechanics). In any system, he says, we have no reason to distinguish
between the so-called <i>real</i> gravitational force and the so-called <i>fictitious</i> centrifugal forces&#x2014;if we wish so to express it gravitational force is fictitious
force.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e5146src" href="#xd29e5146">1</a> A particle moving in the neighborhood of material bodies moves according to a law
of inertia&#x2014;a physical law expressible, therefore, in a manner quite independent of
the choice of coordinates. The law of inertia is <i>that a particle left to itself moves along the geodesics or shortest lines in the
space</i>. If the particle is remote from other bodies the space has the Euclidean character
and we have Newton&#x2019;s law of inertia; otherwise the particle is in a space of a non-Euclidean
character (the space being always the four-dimensional space) and the path of the
particle is along a geodesic in that space. Einstein, in order to make the theory
more concrete, makes a certain stipulation as to the nature of the gravitational space
which stipulation is expressed, as are all physical laws, by means of a tensor equation&#x2014;and
this is sometimes called his law of gravitation.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be well, in exemplification, to explain why light rays, which pass
close to the sun, should be bent according to the new theory. It is <i>assumed</i> that light rays travel along certain geodesics known as minimal geodesics. The sun
has an intense gravitational field near it&#x2014;or, as we now say, the <span class="pagenum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>departure of the four-dimensional space from the Euclidean is very marked for points
near the sun&#x2014;but for points so remote as the earth this departure is so small as to
be negligible. Hence the form of the geodesics near the sun is different from that
near the earth. <i>If the space surrounding the sun were Euclidean the actual paths of the light rays</i> would appear different from geodesics or straight-lines. Hence Einstein speaks of
the curvature of the light rays due to the gravitational field of the sun; but we
must not be misled by a phrase. Light always travels along geodesics (or straight
lines&#x2014;the only definition we have of a <i>straight line</i> is that it is a geodesic); but, owing to the &#x201c;distortion&#x201d; of the space they traverse,
due to the sun, these geodesics reach us with a direction different from that they
would have if they did not pass through the markedly non-Euclidean space near the
sun.
</p>
<p>The consideration of the fundamental four-dimensional space as being non-Euclidean
where matter is present gives a possibility of an answer to the world old question:
Is space finite or infinite? Is time eternal or finite? The fascinating possibility
arises that the space may be like the two-dimensional surface of a sphere which to
a limited experience seems infinite in extent and flat or Euclidean in character.
A new Columbus now asks us to consider other possibilities in which we should have
a finite universe&#x2014;finite not only as to space measurement but as to time (for the
space may be such that all of the four coordinates of its points are bounded in magnitude).
However, although Einstein speaks of the possibility of a finite universe, we do not,
personally, think his <span class="pagenum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>argument convincing. Points on a sphere may be located by the Cartesian coordinates
of their stereographic projections on the equatorial plane and these coordinates,
which might well be those actually measured, are not bounded.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Special Relativity Theory</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In our account of the Einstein theory we have not followed its historical order of
development for two reasons. Firstly, the earlier Special Relativity Theory properly
belongs to a school of thought diametrically opposed to that furnishing the &#x201c;General
Theory of Relativity&#x201d; and, secondly, the latter cannot be obtained from the former
by the process of generalization as commonly understood. Einstein, when proposing
the earlier theory, adopted the position of the empiricist so that to him the phrase,
<i>a point in space</i>, had no meaning without a material framework of reference in which to measure space
distances. When he came to investigate what is meant by time and when he asked the
question &#x201c;what is meant by the statement that two remote events are simultaneous?&#x201d;
it became evident that some mode of communication between the two places is necessary;
the mode adopted was that by means of light-signals. The fundamental hypothesis was
then made that the velocity of such signals is independent of the velocity of their
source (some hypothesis is necessary if we wish to compare the time associated with
events, when one material reference-system is used, and the corresponding time when
another in motion relative to the first is adopted). It develops <span class="pagenum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>that time and space measurements are inextricably interwoven; there is no such thing
as <i>the</i> length of a body or <i>the</i> duration of an event but rather these are <i>relative</i> to the reference-system.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e5190src" href="#xd29e5190">2</a> Minkowski introduced the idea of the space of events&#x2014;of four dimensions&#x2014;but this
space was supposed Euclidean like the three-dimensional space of his predecessors.
To Einstein belongs the credit of taking from this representation a purely formal
mathematical character and of insisting that the &#x201c;real&#x201d; space&#x2014;whose distances have
a physical significance&#x2014;is the four-dimensional space. But we cannot insist too strongly
on the fact that in the gravitational space of the general theory there is no postulate
of the constancy of velocity of a light-signal and accordingly no method of assigning
a time to events corresponding to that adopted in the special theory. In this latter
theory attention was confined to material systems moving with uniform velocity with
respect to each other and it developed that the velocity of light was the ultimate
velocity faster than which no system could move&#x2014;a result surprising and <i>a priori</i> rather repugnant. It is merely a consequence of our mode of comparing times of events;
if some other method&#x2014;thought transference, let us say&#x2014;were possible the velocity of
this would be the &#x201c;limiting velocity.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>In conclusion we should remark that the postulated equivalence of &#x201c;gravitational&#x201d;
and &#x201c;centrifugal&#x201d; forces demands that anything possessed of inertia will be acted
upon by a gravitational field and <span class="pagenum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>this leads to a possible identification of matter and <i>energy</i>. Further our guiding idea (a) will prompt us to say, following the example of Faraday
in his electrical researches, that the geodesics of a gravitational space have a physical
existence as distinct from a mere mathematical one. The four-dimensional space we
may call the <i>ether</i>, and so restore this bearer of physical forces to the position it lost when, as a
three-dimensional idea in the Special Relativity Theory, it had to bear an identical
relation to a multitude of relatively moving material systems. The reason for our
seemingly paradoxical title for an essay on Relativity will be clear when it is remembered
that in the new theory we consider those space-time properties which are <i>absolute</i> or devoid of reference to any particular material reference-frame. Nevertheless,
although the general characteristics of the theory are thus described, without reference
to experiment, when the theory is to be tested it is necessary to state what the four
coordinates discussed actually are&#x2014;how they are determined by measurement. It is our
opinion that much remains to be done to place this portion of the subject on a satisfactory
basis. For example, in the derivation of the nature of the gravitational space, surrounding
a single attracting body, most of the accounts use Cartesian coordinates as <i>if the space were Euclidean</i> and step from these to polar coordinates by the formulæ familiar in Euclidean geometry.
But these details are, perhaps, like matters of elegance, if we shall be allowed to
give Einstein&#x2019;s quotation from Boltzmann, to be left to the &#x201c;tailor and the cobbler.&#x201d;

<p class="first">The Theory of Relativity will be treated first from the physical side, leaving the
three astronomical tests to which it has been put to be discussed later. There is
one astronomical fact however that must be mentioned in this connection, and this
is the discovery of the aberration of light by Bradley in 1726. It is found that every
star in the heavens apparently describes a small annual ellipse, whose major axis
is 41&#x2033; in length. This Bradley showed to be due to a combination of the velocity of
the earth in its orbit, and the velocity of light; and it is so explained in all the
elementary text-books on astronomy. It implies a stationary ether through which the
earth is moving. The importance of this statement will appear presently.
</p>
<p>The subject is usually illustrated by supposing a <span class="pagenum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>man to go out in a rainstorm carrying a vertical tube. If the rain is falling vertically,
and the man stands still, the sides of the tube will not be wet, save by an occasional
drop, but if the tube is moved, it must then be inclined forward in order to keep
it dry. The angle of inclination, which corresponds to aberration, will depend on
the relative velocity of the tube, corresponding to the earth, and the rain drops
which correspond to the waves of light.
</p>
<p>If three lines are dropped upon a point in space, each line being perpendicular to
the plane containing the other two, we have what is known as a system of coordinates.
Einstein&#x2019;s original theory of relativity, which he now designates as the &#x201c;special
theory,&#x201d; depends on two principles. The first is that &#x201c;Every law of nature which holds
good with respect to a coordinate system <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span> must also hold good for any other system <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>K&#x2032;</i></span>, provided that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>K&#x2032;</i></span> are in uniform movement of translation.&#x201d; The second principle is that &#x201c;Light in a
vacuum has a definite and constant velocity, independent of the velocity of its source.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>These two sentences may be considered as authoritative, being quoted in Einstein&#x2019;s
own words.<sup><a href="#n1" id="s1">1</a></sup> The first of these principles need not greatly surprise us. The second is not well
expressed, because it is ambiguous. He does not say how the first &#x201c;velocity&#x201d; is measured,
whether relatively to the ether or relatively to the observer. In fact this is the
very gist of the whole matter, as we shall presently see. In the case of sound the
velocity is constant with regard to the medium, the air, in the case of light it is
supposed to be constant with regard to the <span class="pagenum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>observer. It reaches him with a constant velocity, no matter how he moves.
</p>
<p>In order to understand this statement clearly let us consider the appended tabular
diagram. On a calm day imagine a source of sound at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span> in line <i>a</i>. This may be either a gun or a bell. Imagine an observer 1,100 feet distant, located
at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span>. The velocity of sound in air is 1,100 feet per second. This velocity we will take
as unity, as indicated in the third column, and the velocity with which the sound
reaches the observer is also 1, as shown in the fourth. It will reach him in a unit
interval of 1 second, as shown in the fifth. If the bell is struck, it will give its
normal pitch or frequency, which we will also call unity, in the sixth column.
</p>
<p>Now imagine case <i>b</i> where the observer is on a train advancing toward <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>S</i></span>. When he is 1,100 feet distant, the gun is fired, but as he is advancing toward it,
he hears it at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> in rather less than a second, as shown in the fifth column. The velocity of the sound
with regard to him is rather more than unity, as shown in the fourth column. If the
bell is sounded, the pitch, that is the frequency, is raised, because he receives
more sound waves per second than before.
</p>
<p>In case <i>c</i> the observer is stationary, but the source of sound is receding. At a distance of
1,100 feet the gun is fired, and the observer hears it after an interval of just one
second, as in case <i>a</i>. The velocities with regard to the observer and through the medium are also unity.
If the bell is struck the pitch is lowered, since he receives fewer sound waves per
second, the reverse of case <i>b</i>.

</p>
<p>In case <i>d</i> imagine the source and the observer 1,100 feet apart, and advancing on the same train.
When the gun is fired, the velocity of the sound waves will be greater with regard
to the observer, and he will hear the sound in less than a second, as in case <i>b</i>. When the bell is struck it will have the normal pitch, the same as in case <i>a</i>.
</p>
<p>We find therefore that for sound the velocity with regard to the medium is always
unity, while the velocity with regard to the observer, and the interval elapsed, depend
only on the motion of the observer himself, and are independent of the motion of the
source. The frequency of the vibrations, on the other hand, depends only on the relative
motion of the observer and the source, but is independent of their common motion in
any direction. Further, it makes no difference whether the source and the observer
are moving on a train, or whether they are stationary, and a uniform wind is blowing
past them.
</p>
<p>In the case of light waves we shall find a very different state of affairs, although
the rules for frequency are the same as they are for sound. In case <i>A</i> we have the normal conditions, where both the <span class="pagenum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>source and observers are stationary. In case <i>B</i> we have a representation of the Michelson-Morley experiment as supplemented by that
of Majorana,<sup><a href="#n2" id="s2">2</a></sup> where the source is stationary and the observer advances. Unlike the case of sound,
the interval elapsed, as shown by the experiment, is now the same as in case <i>A</i>, and since the distance to the observer is less, the velocity of light with respect
to the ether must also be less than unity. Since the observer is advancing against
the light, this will permit the velocity of light with regard to the observer to remain
unity, in conformity with the second principle of relativity. Compare with case <i>b</i> for sound. As Jeans expresses it, &#x201c;The velocity of light in all directions is the
same, whatever the motion of the observer.&#x201d;<sup><a href="#n3" id="s3">3</a></sup> That is to say it appears to be the same to him, however he moves.
</p>
<p>Case <i>C</i> represents Einstein&#x2019;s statement, as confirmed by Majorana&#x2019;s experiment. It does not
differ from case <i>c</i> for sound. Case <i>D</i> is more complex, but accepting the statement above that the velocity is constant
with regard to the observer, we see that the velocity through the medium must be less,
and that the interval elapsed will be constant, as in case <i>B</i>. Could we use the brighter stars and planets as sources of light, several of these
cases could be further tested.
</p>
<p>This brings us at once to statements that contradict our common sense. For instance,
<span class="corr" id="xd29e5511" title="Source: Jean">Jeans</span> says &#x201c;no matter what the velocity of the observer is, the light surface, as observed
by that observer, is invariably a sphere having that observer as center.&#x201d;<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> That is to say the light surface, or wave front, is a contracting, <span class="pagenum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>not an expanding, sphere. This, if confirmed, would go a long way toward making our
universe a subjective rather than an objective phenomenon. Again imagine a flash of
light, such as an explosion, to occur when an observer is in a given position. It
makes no difference how the observer may move while the light is approaching him,
whether several miles forward or backward, the light will reach him in exactly the
same time, as is shown by Michelson&#x2019;s experiment. Or if two observers are at the same
spot when the explosion occurs, and one moves forward, and the other backward, they
will both see the explosion at exactly the same instant.
</p>
<p>This sounds ridiculous, but not only is it what Jeans says, but it is the logical
interpretation of Einstein&#x2019;s second principle, if Einstein means by velocity, velocity
with regard to the observer. If he means velocity with regard to the medium, then
the case is exactly the same as that of sound in air, and Michelson&#x2019;s experiment as
well as the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of light are contradicted. This theory is now universally
accepted, and Michelson&#x2019;s experiment has been carefully repeated by other observers,
and fully confirmed. This is the very heart of the relativity question.
</p>
<p>If we state the matter objectively it comes to this. The velocity of light with regard
to the ether is a variable quantity, depending merely on where the observer chooses
to go. As Eddington well says, &#x201c;these relations to the ether have no effect on the
phenomena and can be disregarded&#x2014;a step which appears to divest the ether of the last
remnants of substantiality.&#x201d;<sup><a href="#n4" id="s4">4</a></sup>
<span class="pagenum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>The only way of avoiding this apparent absurdity seems to be to consider that the
ether moves with the earth. Michelson&#x2019;s result would then be fully explained. Of course
this can only be true for a few miles above the earth&#x2019;s surface. Beyond that the ether
must either be stationary or move with the sun. The velocity of light with regard
to the ether would then be a constant, just as the velocity of sound is constant with
regard to the air. This would contradict Einstein&#x2019;s second principle as it is generally
understood. The trouble with this suggestion is that it fails to account for aberration,
which, as already explained, appears to require that the earth should be moving through
the ether. To meet this emergency would involve some modification of the undulatory
theory of light, which apparently would not be impossible, but has not yet been made.
</p>
<p>In 1915 Einstein brought out an extension of his first principle. This he calls the
&#x201c;general theory of relativity.&#x201d; It states that in our choice of coordinate systems
we &#x201c;should not be limited in any way so far as their state of motion is concerned.&#x201d;<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> This leads to the three astronomical consequences mentioned later in this paper,
two of which have been more or less confirmed, and the third practically contradicted
as far as quantitative measures are concerned.<sup><a href="#n5" id="s5">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p>As is well known the kinetic energy of a moving body may be expressed as <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f310.1.svg" alt="e equals 1 slash 2 m v squared" title="e equals 1 slash 2 m v squared" class="f310.1frml"></span>, but if the body is charged electrically, the fraction becomes <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f310.2.svg" alt="1 slash 2 left-parenthesis m plus m prime right-parenthesis v squared" title="1 slash 2 left-parenthesis m plus m prime right-parenthesis v squared" class="f310.2frml"></span>, where <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>m&#x2032;</i></span> is a quantity dependent on the square of the electrical charge. That is to say, <span class="pagenum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>we have the normal mass of the body, and also what we may call its electrical mass.
If when in this condition a portion of the mass is electrical, the question at once
occurs to us, why may not the whole mass be electrical, in other words, a form of
energy? Although this has not been satisfactorily proved hitherto, yet such is the
general belief among physicists. As Einstein puts it &#x201c;inert mass is nothing else than
latent energy.&#x201d;<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> The same idea is sometimes expressed as &#x201c;the mass of ordinary matter is due to the
electromagnetic energy of its ultimate particles, and electromagnetic energy wherever
found must possess mass, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>inertia</i>.&#x201d;<sup><a href="#n6" id="s6">6</a></sup> If that is so, since a ray of light on the undulatory theory is a form of electromagnetic
energy, it too must possess mass. Since all mass with which we are familiar is subject
to the attraction of gravitation, it seemed likely that a ray of light would be bent
out of its course in passing near the sun, and this as we have seen was proved to
be true at the recent solar eclipse.
</p>
<p>That portion of the mass of a body due to its electrical charge can be readily shown
experimentally to vary with the velocity of the body. Einstein has shown the same
to be true of the normal mass, as is illustrated in the advance of the perihelion
of the orbit of Mercury. He has also pointed out that gravitation, inertia and centrifugal
force are all closely related, and obey similar laws. Thus if we rise from the earth
with accelerated velocity, we apparently increase our weight. Again if the velocity
of rotation of the earth on its axis should be increased, our weight would be diminished.
These <span class="pagenum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>facts are suggestive when we come to consider the ultimate cause of gravitation.
</p>
<p>Another fact which must be rather startling to the older school of scientists is that
momentum is no longer simply <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>mv</i></span>, mass times velocity, but that the velocity of light <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>c</i></span>, comes into the question, and the formula for momentum now assumes the form of
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f312.3.svg" alt="StartFraction m v Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction v squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction" title="StartFraction m v Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction v squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction" class="f312.3frml"></span>
</p>
<p>For ordinary velocities this correction is extremely small, but it has been shown
to be necessary, both theoretically and experimentally, when dealing with the high
velocities with which we are now familiar.
</p>
<p>The theory of relativity is so widespread in its application that several other theories
have become more or less intimately combined with it, for which Einstein is in no
way responsible. One of these is known as the Fitzgerald-Lorentz theory, that all
bodies are subject to a contraction in the direction of their motions through space.
This was first suggested in order to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment, but
has proved inadequate to do so, particularly when the observer is receding from the
source. This contraction is expressed by the same factor used in the denominator of
the revised expression for momentum, given above. Again the quantity <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>c</i></span> is so enormous, that even for large bodies at planetary velocities the contraction
amounts to very little. Thus the earth moving at a speed of eighteen miles per second
in its orbit, is flattened only 1/200,000,000, or 2.5 inches. On the other <span class="pagenum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>hand for high velocities of many thousand miles per second, such as we have become
familiar with in the case of the radioactive substances, the flattening is a very
considerable fraction of the diameter of the moving body, one-half or more, and in
the case of the corpuscles of light, if that theory were adopted, this flattening
becomes equal to the diameter, and their thickness is reduced to zero.
</p>
<p>When we view Einstein&#x2019;s theories from the astronomical standpoint, the earliest fact
bearing on relativity that we need consider was the discovery of aberration, by Bradley,
in 1726, as seen above. In 1872 Airy observed the star &#x3b3; Draconis through a telescope
filled with water. Since the velocity of light is less in water than in air, we should
naturally expect to find the aberration appreciably increased. It was found, on the
other hand, however, to be unaffected.
</p>
<p>In 1887 the results of the famous Michelson-Morley experiment were published.<sup><a href="#n7" id="s7">7</a></sup> In this experiment the velocity of light was measured in various directions with
regard to the motion of the earth in its orbit. If the ether were stationary, and
the earth moving through it, different velocities should be obtained in different
directions. Such was not the case however, and the experiment indicated that the ether
moved with the earth. It thus flatly contradicted the conclusions founded on aberration.
</p>
<p>Einstein&#x2019;s Special Theory of Relativity, of 1905, as we have seen, resolves this contradiction.
But as we shall presently see, it is the General Theory, of 1915, that leads to astronomical
applications of broad scope. It indicates, for instance, that there is <span class="pagenum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>no essential difference between gravitation and inertia. This idea may be crudely
illustrated by our feelings of increased weight when an elevator starts rapidly upwards.
A man while falling freely in space ceases to feel the pull of gravitation.
</p>
<p>But we must not as yet conceive of the theory of relativity as a universally accepted
and unquestioned truth of science. Eddington is its leading English exponent, and
he is supported by such men as Jeans, Larmor, and Jeffreys. On the other hand, the
theory has been severely criticised by Lodge, Fowler, Silberstein, and Sampson. Few
American scientists have expressed any opinions in print on the subject, and the recent
eclipse observations, to which we shall refer later, are to be repeated with more
suitable instruments for verification in 1922, in the hope of obtaining more accurate
and accordant results.<sup><a href="#n8" id="s8">8</a></sup>
</p>
<p>An appurtenance of the Einstein theories which bears much the same relation to them
as does the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction, mentioned above, is the idea, first clearly
stated by Minkowski, that time is a kind of space&#x2014;a fourth dimension. This the reader
will doubtless find to be the most difficult portion of the theory to picture in his
own mind. It is entirely unsupported by experiment or observation, necessarily so,
and is based wholly on mathematical and philosophical conceptions. Our distinction
between space and time seems to be that the direction in which we progress without
effort is time; the other directions, in which we have to make an exertion to move
ourselves, or in which we are carried, are space. How many dimensions empty space
may have, we really have no means of knowing, because <span class="pagenum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>we can neither see nor feel it. Matter we know has three, length, breadth, and thickness,
also that it lies remote from us in three corresponding directions. These facts may
have given us the erroneous impression that space too has only three dimensions. Now
it is claimed that time is a fourth, and that there are also others.
</p>
<p>In order to illustrate this, Eddington asks us to imagine a movie film taken of a
man or of any moving object. Let the separate pictures be cut apart and piled on one
another. This would form a sort of pictorial history of the individual for a brief
interval in his life, in the form of a cube. If we attempt to pick it up, it falls
apart, thus clearly showing the difference between time and space. But suppose it
now all glued together in one solid cube, so that it is no easier to cut a section
in one direction than in another. That is Minkowski&#x2019;s idea of space and time, and
further, that the direction in which we should cut it depends merely on the velocity
with which we are moving through space. I should cut it parallel to the films, but
a man on a rapidly moving star, in order to separate it into space and time, would
cut it in an inclined direction. That is a thing which may be true, but it is one
which we believe no mortal man can clearly picture to himself.
</p>
<p>On the other hand Turner has recently made a very interesting point,<sup><a href="#n9" id="s9">9</a></sup> namely, that the fourth dimension as actually treated by the <span class="corr" id="xd29e5617" title="Source: methematicians">mathematicians</span> is not time itself, but time multiplied by a constant&#x2014;the velocity of light.<sup><a href="#n10" id="s10">10</a></sup> Without affecting the astronomical proofs of relativity at all, this simplifies our
conceptions enormously. In ordinary everyday life <span class="pagenum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>time and space cannot be identical, any more than a yard can be identical with a quart.
On what is known to physicists as the centimeter-gram-second system, distance is represented
by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>l</i></span>, mass by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>m</i></span>, and time by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span>. Velocity is then distance divided by time, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f316.4.svg" alt="l slash t" title="l slash t" class="f316.4frml"></span>, or as we say in English units, so many feet per second, and the fourth dimension
may be expressed as time multiplied by velocity, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f316.5.svg" alt="t times l slash t equals l" title="t times l slash t equals l" class="f316.5frml"></span>. That is to say, it is simply distance, just like the other three dimensions. To
say that time is the fourth dimension from this point of view, appears to us just
as ridiculous as it would be to attempt to measure the velocity of a train in quarts.
It is quite correct, however, although unusual, to speak of a given train as moving
at a speed of 10 quarts per square inch per second, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f316.6.svg" alt="l cubed slash l squared t equals l slash t" title="l cubed slash l squared t equals l slash t" class="f316.6frml"></span>. This would be equivalent to a velocity of 33 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>If I wish to give a complete dimensional description of myself in my four dimensions,
I must give my length, my breadth, and my thickness, ever since I came into being,
and also the course I have traversed through space since that time. This latter distance
will be expressed in terms of a unit whose length is 186,000 miles, the distance traversed
by light in one second. The distance which I travel through space annually is enormous,
and very complex as to direction. It involves not merely my own motions as I cross
the room, or take a train or steamer, but also those due to the rotation of the earth
on its axis, its revolution round the sun, and the motion of the latter through the
heavens. In general I travel, or in other words increase my length in the fourth dimension,
by over 4,000 units <span class="pagenum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>a year. The fourth dimension accordingly, if this view is accepted, is simply a distance
like the other three, and perfectly easy to understand.
</p>
<p>We now come to the three actual tests by which the theory has been tried. The planets
as is well known revolve about the sun in ellipses, with the sun in one of the foci.
That is to say, the sun is not in the center, but a little on one side of it. The
end of the ellipse where the planet comes nearest to the sun is called the perihelion,
and here the planet is moving most rapidly. The other end is called the aphelion,
and here the motion is slowest. According to Newton&#x2019;s theory of gravitation, if a
spherical sun possesses a single planet or companion, its orbit will be permanently
fixed in space unless perturbed by some other body. If a second planet exist, it will
cause the perihelion of the first slowly to advance. According to Einstein the mass
of a planet depends in part on its velocity. It will therefore be less at aphelion
where it is moving slowly than at perihelion where it is moving rapidly, consequently
in addition to the Newtonian attraction we have another one which increases as we
approach the sun. The effect of this will be to cause the perihelion of the orbit
to advance, whether there is a second planet or not.
</p>
<p>Among the larger planets Mercury has the most eccentric orbit, and it also moves most
rapidly, so that it is particularly well adapted to test the relativity theory. The
observed advance of its perihelion is 574&#x2033; per century, instead of the theoretical
figure 532&#x2033;, due to the other planets&#x2014;a difference of 42&#x2033;.<sup><a href="#n11" id="s11">11</a></sup> This has long been a puzzling discrepancy between observation and the law of gravitation.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>Prior to Einstein, attempts were made to eliminate it by assuming a certain oblateness
of the solar disk. If the equatorial diameter exceeded the polar by only 0&#x2033;.5 the
whole advance would be accounted for, but not only has this ellipticity failed of
detection, but if it existed, it should produce a very noticeable and inadmissible
change in the inclination of Mercury&#x2019;s orbit, amounting to about 3&#x2033; per century, as
has been demonstrated by both Herzer and Newcomb.<sup><a href="#n12" id="s12">12</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Einstein from computations alone, without introducing any new constants or hypotheses
whatever, showed, if the theory of relativity be accepted, that the sun should produce
an acceleration of 43&#x2033; per century, thus entirely accounting for the observed discrepancy,
far within the limits of accuracy of the observations. The only other planet whose
orbit has a large eccentricity, and that is suitable for investigation, is the planet
Mars. Here the discrepancy between observation and theory is very slight, only 4&#x2033;,
and a portion of that may be due to the attraction of the asteroids. This deviation
is so slight that it may well be due entirely to accidental errors of observation,
but however that may be, Einstein&#x2019;s theory reduces it to 2&#x2033;.7.
</p>
<p>This all seems very satisfactory and complete, but the trouble with it is that the
coincidence for Mercury is rather too good. It is based on the assumption that the
sun is a perfect sphere, and that the density of its surface is uniform from the equator
to the poles. This would doubtless be true if the sun did not revolve on its axis.
In point of fact it does revolve, in a period in general of about 26 <span class="pagenum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>days. Consequently an object on its equator must experience a certain amount of centrifugal
force. Therefore if its surface were of uniform density the shape of the sun would
be an oblate spheroid.
</p>
<p>It can be readily shown that the theoretical excess of the equatorial over the polar
diameter, due to the centrifugal force, should amount to only 0&#x2033;.04, an amount which
could hardly be detected by observation, and might readily be concealed by a slight
excess of equatorial over polar density. Any reasonable excess of density at the center
would diminish this result but slightly. The molecular weight of the central material<sup><a href="#n13" id="s13">13</a></sup> is probably about 2. This computed equatorial excess is one-twelfth of the amount
necessary to cause the observed advance, and should therefore cause an advance of
the perihelion of about 3&#x2033;.5 per century, reducing the difference between the observed
advance and that caused by gravitation to 38&#x2033;.5. According to Einstein the advance
due to relativity should be, as we saw, 43&#x2033;, a discrepancy of 4&#x2033;.5 per century, or
10 per cent. Jeffreys has remarked that any discrepancy such as 10&#x2033; &#x201c;would be fatal
to a theory such as Einstein&#x2019;s, which contains no arbitrary constituent capable of
adjustment to suit empirical facts.&#x201d;<sup><a href="#n14" id="s14">14</a></sup> It must be pointed out here however, that so far as known, this small correction
to the motion of Mercury&#x2019;s perihelion has not previously been suggested, so that there
has been no opportunity hitherto for its criticism by others.

<p>It was due largely to the success with Mercury that it was decided to put the relativity
theory to another test. According to the Newtonian theory, <span class="pagenum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>as stated by Newton himself, corpuscles as well as planets have mass, and must therefore
be attracted by the sun. According to Einstein, owing to their high velocity, this
attraction must be twice as great as it would be according to the theory of gravitation.
If the ray of light proceeding from a star were to pass nearly tangent to the sun&#x2019;s
limb it should be deflected 0&#x2033;.87 according to Newton. According to the theory of
relativity it should be deflected 1&#x2033;.75. Stars of course cannot usually be observed
near the sun. It is therefore necessary to take advantage of a total solar eclipse,
when the sun is completely hidden by the moon, in order to secure these observations.
</p>
<p>Two expeditions, one to Africa, and one to South America, observed successfully the
total eclipse of May 29, 1919. The former was located on the Island of Principe in
the Gulf of Guinea. The latter was located at Sobral, Brazil. Their equipment and
results are shown in the following table, where the successive columns give the location,
the aperture in inches of the telescopes employed, their focus in feet, the number
of plates secured, the number of stars measured, their mean deduced deflection from
their true positions by the attraction of the sun, and the deviations from the theoretical
results.<sup><a href="#n15" id="s15">15</a></sup> In the first and last line of the table shown herewith, this

<p>deviation is taken from Einstein&#x2019;s computed value of <span class="pagenum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>1&#x2033;.75. In the second line the difference shown is from the value required by the Newtonian
theory, 0&#x2033;.87. The results obtained with this telescope were rejected however, although
they were much the most numerous, because it was found that for some reason, supposed
to be the heating of the mirror by the sun before the eclipse, the star images were
slightly out of focus, and were therefore considered unreliable. The results with
the two other telescopes were not very accordant, but the 4-inch had the longer focus,
secured the greater number of plates, and showed the greater number of stars. The
results obtained with it therefore appear to have been the more reliable. They differ
from Einstein&#x2019;s prediction by 13 per cent. In future expeditions to test this question,
the mirror in front of the telescope will be eliminated.
</p>
<p>We now come to the final test which has been applied to Einstein&#x2019;s theory. Einstein
showed that in the intense gravitational field of the sun, the theory of relativity
required that all of the spectrum lines should be shifted slightly toward the red
end. The shift however is exceedingly small, and can only be detected and measured
with the most powerful modern instruments. Moreover only certain lines can be used,
because owing to varying pressure in the solar atmosphere, which affects many lines,
as well as to rapid motion in the line of sight, which may affect all of them, still
larger displacements are liable to occur.
</p>
<p>According to the theory of relativity the displacement of the lines should be <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f323.1.svg" alt="plus 0.0080 upper A" title="plus 0.0080 upper A" class="f323.1frml"></span>. St. John at Mt. Wilson found a displacement for the cyanogen <span class="pagenum" id="pb305">[<a href="#pb305">305</a>]</span>lines of only <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f324.1.svg" alt="plus 0.0018 upper A" title="plus 0.0018 upper A" class="f324.1frml"></span>.<sup><a href="#n16" id="s16">16</a></sup> Evershed at Kodaikanal found +0.0060 at the north pole of the sun, and +0.0080 at
the south pole. These latter values however were only for the stronger lines. The
weaker lines give much smaller shifts, as do those of calcium and magnesium.<sup><a href="#n17" id="s17">17</a></sup> According to Einstein all lines should give nearly the same shift, an amount proportional
to the wave length. It therefore appears that we must conclude by saying that Einstein&#x2019;s
theory of relativity has been partially, but not completely, verified.

<p class="byline">BY PROFESSOR HENRY NORRIS RUSSELL, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Can a small child catch a baseball moving sixty miles an hour without getting hurt?
We should probably answer &#x201c;No&#x201d;&#x2014;but suppose that the boy and his father were sitting
side by side in an express train, and the ball was tossed lightly from one to the
other. Then there would be no trouble about it, whether the train was standing still,
or going at full speed. Only the <i>relative</i> motion of ball and boy would count.
</p>
<p>This every-day experience is a good illustration of the much discussed Principle of
Relativity, in its simplest form. If there were no jolting, the motion of the train,
<i>straight ahead at a uniform speed, would have no effect at all upon the relative motions
of objects inside it</i>, nor on the forces required to produce or change these motions. Indeed, the motion
of the earth in its orbit, which is free from all jar, but a thousand times faster,
does not influence even the most delicate apparatus. We are quite unconscious of it,
and would not know that the earth <span class="pagenum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>was moving, if we could not see other bodies outside it. This sort of relativity has
been recognized for more than two centuries and lies at the bottom of all our ordinary
dynamical reasoning, upon which both science and engineering are based.
</p>
<p>But there are other things in nature besides moving bodies,&#x2014;above all, light, which
is intimately related to electricity and magnetism, and can travel through empty space,
between the stars. It moves at the enormous speed of 186,000 miles per second, and
behaves exactly like a series of vibrations or &#x201c;waves.&#x201d; We naturally think of it as
travelling through some medium, and call this thing, which carries the light, the
&#x201c;ether.&#x201d;

</p>
<p>Can we tell whether we are moving through this ether, even though all parts of our
apparatus move together, and at the same rate? Suppose that we have two mirrors, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>N</i></span>, at equal distances, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>d</i></span>, from a point <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span>, but in directions at right angles to one another, and send out a flash of light
from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span>. If everything is at rest, the reflected flashes will evidently come back to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> at the same instant, and the <span class="pagenum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>elapsed time will be <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.1.svg" alt="2 d slash c" title="2 d slash c" class="f327.1frml"></span> seconds if <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>c</i></span> is the velocity of light.
</p>
<p>But suppose that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>, and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>N</i></span> are fastened to a rigid frame work, and all moving in the direction <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.6.svg" alt="upper O upper M" title="upper O upper M" class="f327.6frml"></span>, with velocity <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>V</i></span>. The light which goes from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> toward <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>, at the speed <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>c</i></span>, will overtake it with the difference of their speeds, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.11.svg" alt="c minus v" title="c minus v" class="f327.11frml"></span>, taking <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.12.svg" alt="d slash left-parenthesis c minus v right-parenthesis" title="d slash left-parenthesis c minus v right-parenthesis" class="f327.12frml"></span> seconds to reach <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>. On the way back, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> will be advancing to meet it, and the return trip will occupy <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.15.svg" alt="d slash left-parenthesis c plus v right-parenthesis" title="d slash left-parenthesis c plus v right-parenthesis" class="f327.15frml"></span> seconds. The elapsed time for the round trip comes out <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.16.svg" alt="2 c d slash left-parenthesis c squared minus v squared right-parenthesis" title="2 c d slash left-parenthesis c squared minus v squared right-parenthesis" class="f327.16frml"></span> seconds, which is <i>longer</i> than when the system was at rest&#x2014;the loss of time in the &#x201c;stern chase&#x201d; exceeding
the saving on the return.
</p>
<p>The light which is reflected from N has a different history. When it starts, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>N</i></span> have certain positions in the ether, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.19.svg" alt="upper O 1" title="upper O 1" class="f327.19frml"></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.20.svg" alt="upper N 1" title="upper N 1" class="f327.20frml"></span>. By the time it reaches the mirror, this is at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.21.svg" alt="upper N 2" title="upper N 2" class="f327.21frml"></span>, and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> is at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.23.svg" alt="upper O 2" title="upper O 2" class="f327.23frml"></span>, and when it returns, it finds <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> at <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.25.svg" alt="upper O 3" title="upper O 3" class="f327.25frml"></span>. The distances for the outward and inward journeys are now equal, but (as is obvious
from the figure), each of them is greater than <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>d</i></span>, or <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.27.svg" alt="upper O 2 upper N 2" title="upper O 2 upper N 2" class="f327.27frml"></span>, and the time for the round trip will be correspondingly increased. A simple calculation
shows that it is <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.28.svg" alt="2 d slash StartRoot c squared minus v squared EndRoot" title="2 d slash StartRoot c squared minus v squared EndRoot" class="f327.28frml"></span>.
</p>
<p>The increase above the time required when the system was at rest is less in this case
than the preceding. Hence, if the apparatus is moving through the ether, the flashes
reflected from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>N</i></span> will not return at the same instant.
</p>
<p>For such velocities as are attainable&#x2014;even the 18 miles per second of the earth in
its orbit&#x2014;the difference is less than a hundred-millionth of the <span class="pagenum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>elapsed time. Nevertheless, Michelson and Morley tried to detect it in their famous
experiment.
</p>
<p>A beam of light was allowed to fall obliquely upon a clear glass mirror (placed at
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> in the diagram) which reflected part of it toward the mirror, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span>, and let the rest pass through to the mirror <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>N</i></span>. By reuniting the beams after their round trips, it was possible to tell whether
one had gained upon the other by even a small fraction of the time of vibration of
a single light wave. The apparatus was so sensitive that the predicted difference,
though amounting to less than a millionth part of a billionth of a second, could easily
have been measured; but they actually found <i>no difference at all</i>&#x2014;though the earth is certainly in motion.
</p>
<p>Other optical experiments, more intricate, and even more delicate, were attempted,
with the same object of detecting the motion of the earth through the ether; and they
all failed.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Special Theory and Its Surprising Consequences</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was upon these facts that Einstein based his original, or &#x201c;special&#x201d; theory of Relativity.
He assumed boldly that <i>the universe is so constituted that uniform straight-ahead motion of an observer and
all his apparatus will not produce any difference whatever in the result of any physical
process or experiment of any kind</i>. Granting this, it follows that if all objects in the visible universe were moving
uniformly together in any direction, no matter how fast, we could not find this out
at all. We cannot <span class="pagenum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>determine whether the universe, as a whole, is at rest or in motion, and may as well
make one guess as another. Only the <i>relative</i> motions of its parts can be detected or studied.
</p>
<p>This seems simple and easy enough to understand. But the consequences which follow
from it are extraordinary, and at first acquaintance seem almost absurd.
</p>
<p>In the first place, if an observer measures the velocity of light, he must always
get the same result, no matter how fast he and his apparatus are moving, or in what
direction (so long as the motion is uniform and rectilinear). This sounds harmless;
but let us go back to the Michelson-Morley experiment where the light came back in
exactly the same time from the two mirrors. If the observer supposes himself to be
at rest, he will say that the distances <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.6.svg" alt="upper O upper M" title="upper O upper M" class="f327.6frml"></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f329.2.svg" alt="upper O upper N" title="upper O upper N" class="f329.2frml"></span> were equal. But if he fancies that the whole universe is moving in the direction
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.6.svg" alt="upper O upper M" title="upper O upper M" class="f327.6frml"></span>, he will conclude that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> is nearer to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> than <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>N</i></span> is&#x2014;for if they were equidistant, the round-trip would take longer in the first case,
as we have proved. If once more he fancies that the universe is moving in the direction
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f329.2.svg" alt="upper O upper N" title="upper O upper N" class="f329.2frml"></span>, he will conclude that N is nearer to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>O</i></span> than <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>M</i></span> is. <i>His answer to the question which of the two distances, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f327.6.svg" alt="upper O upper M" title="upper O upper M" class="f327.6frml"></span> or <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f329.2.svg" alt="upper O upper N" title="upper O upper N" class="f329.2frml"></span>, is the greater will therefore depend on his assumption about the motion of the universe
as a whole.</i>
</p>
<p>Similar complications arise in the measurement of time. Suppose that we have two observers,
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>, provided with clocks which run with perfect uniformity, and mirrors to reflect light
signals to one another. At noon exactly by his clock, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> sends a <span class="pagenum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>flash of light towards <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>. <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> sees it come in at 12:01 by <i>his</i> clock. The flash reflected from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>&#x2019;s mirror reaches <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> at 12:02 by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>&#x2019;s clock. They communicate these observations to one another.
</p>
<p>If <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> regard themselves as being at rest, they will agree that the light took as long to
go out as it did to come back, and therefore that it reached <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> at just 12:01 by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>&#x2019;s clock, and that the two clocks are synchronized. But they may, if they please,
suppose that they (and the whole universe) are moving in the direction from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> towards <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>, with half the speed of light. They will then say that the light had a &#x201c;stern chase&#x201d;
to reach <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>, and took three times as long to go out as to come back. This means that it got to
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> at 1½ minutes past noon by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>&#x2019;s clock, and that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>&#x2019;s clock is slow compared with <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>&#x2019;s. If they should assume that they were moving with the same speed in the opposite
direction, they would conclude that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>&#x2019;s clock is half a minute fast.
</p>
<p>Hence <i>their answer to the question whether two events at different places happen at the
same time, or at different times, will depend on their assumption about the motion
of the universe as a whole</i>.
</p>
<p>Once more, let us suppose that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>, with their clocks and mirrors, are in relative motion, with half the speed of light,
and pass one another at noon by both clocks. At 12:02 by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>&#x2019;s clock, he sends a flash of light, which reaches <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> at 12:04 by his clock, is reflected, and gets back to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>&#x2019;s clock at 12:06. They signal these results to each other, and sit down to work them
out. <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> thinks that he is at rest, and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> moving. He therefore concludes that the light had the same distance to go out as
to return <span class="pagenum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>to him and took two seconds each way, reaching <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> at 12:04 by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>&#x2019;s clock, and that the two clocks, which agreed then, as well as at noon, are running
at the same rate.
</p>
<p><span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>, on the contrary, thinks that <i>he</i> is at rest and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> in motion. He then concludes that <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span> was much nearer when he sent out the flash than when he got it back, and that the
light had three times as far to travel on the return journey. This means that it was
12:03 by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>&#x2019;s clock at the instant when the light reached <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>&#x2019;s clock read 12:04. Hence <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>A</i></span>&#x2019;s clock is running slow, compared with <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>B</i></span>&#x2019;s.
</p>
<p>Hence <i>the answer to the question whether two intervals of time, measured by observers who
are in motion relative to one another, are of the same or of different durations,
depends upon their assumptions about the motion of the universe as a whole</i>.
</p>
<p>Now we must remember that one assumption about the motion of the universe as a whole
is <span class="corr" id="xd29e6288" title="Source: axactly">exactly</span> as good&#x2014;or bad&#x2014;as another. No possible experiment can distinguish between them. Hence
on the Principle of Relativity, we have left no <i>absolute</i> measurement of time or space. Whether two distances in different directions are to
be called equal or not&#x2014;whether two events in different places are to be called simultaneous
or not&#x2014;depends on our arbitrary choice of such an assumption, or &#x201c;frame of reference.&#x201d;
All the various schemes of measurement corresponding to these assumptions will, when
applied to any imaginable experiment, predict exactly the same phenomena. But, in
certain important cases, these predictions differ from those of the old familiar theory,
and, <i>every time that such experiments <span class="pagenum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>have been tried, the result has agreed with the new theory, and not with the old</i>.
</p>
<p>We are therefore driven to accept the theory of relativity, strange as it is, as being
more nearly &#x201c;true to nature&#x201d; than our older ideas. Fortunately, the difference between
the results of the two become important only when we assume that the whole visible
universe is moving together much faster than any of its parts are moving relatively
to one another. Unless we make such an unwarranted assumption, the differences are
so small that it takes the most ingenious and precise experiments to reveal them.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Not content with all this, Einstein proceeded, a few years ago, to develop a &#x201c;general&#x201d;
theory of relativity, which includes the effects of gravitation.
</p>
<p>To make this idea clear, let us imagine two observers, each, with his measuring instruments,
in a large and perfectly impervious box, which forms his &#x201c;closed system.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The first observer, with his box and its contents, alone in space, is entirely at
rest.
</p>
<p>The second observer, with his box and its contents, is, it may be imagined, near the
earth or the sun or some star, and falling freely under the influence of its gravitation.
</p>
<p>This second box and its contents, including the observer, will then fall under the
gravitational force, that is, get up an ever-increasing speed, but at exactly the
same rate, so that there will be no tendency for their relative positions to be altered.
<span class="pagenum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to Newton&#x2019;s principles, this will make not the slightest difference in the
motions of the physical objects comprising the system or their attractions on one
another, so that no dynamical experiment can distinguish between the condition of
the freely falling observer in the second box and the observer at rest in the first.
</p>
<p>But once more the question arises: What could be done by an optical experiment?
</p>
<p>Einstein assumed that the principle of relativity still applied in this case, so that
it would be impossible to distinguish between the conditions of the observers in the
two boxes by any optical experiment.
</p>
<p>It can easily be seen that it follows from this new generalized relativity that light
cannot travel in a straight line in a gravitational field.
</p>
<p>Imagine that the first observer sets up three slits, all in a straight line. A ray
of light which passes through the first and second will obviously pass exactly through
the third.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p314width"><img src="images/p314.png" alt="" width="580" height="211"></div><p>
</p>
<p>Suppose the observer in the freely falling system attempts the same experiment, having
his slits <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>P</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>Q</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>R</i></span>, equally spaced, and placing them at right angles to the direction in which he is
falling. When the light passes through <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>P</i></span>, the slits will be in certain position <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f333.1.svg" alt="upper P 1 upper Q 1 upper R 1" title="upper P 1 upper Q 1 upper R 1" class="f333.1frml"></span> (Figure). By the time <span class="pagenum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>it reaches <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>Q</i></span>, they will have fallen to a lower level<span class="corr" id="xd29e6343" title="Source: .">,</span> <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f334.2.svg" alt="upper P 2 upper Q 2 upper R 2" title="upper P 2 upper Q 2 upper R 2" class="f334.2frml"></span>, and when it reaches <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>R</i></span>, they will be still lower, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f334.4.svg" alt="upper P 3 upper Q 3 upper R 3" title="upper P 3 upper Q 3 upper R 3" class="f334.4frml"></span>. The times which the light takes to move from <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>P</i></span> to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>Q</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>Q</i></span> to <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>R</i></span> will be the same: but, since the system is falling ever faster and faster the distance
<span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f334.9.svg" alt="upper R 2 upper R 3" title="upper R 2 upper R 3" class="f334.9frml"></span> will be greater than <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><img src="formulas/inline-f334.10.svg" alt="upper Q 1 upper Q 2" title="upper Q 1 upper Q 2" class="f334.10frml"></span>. Hence, if the light which has passed through <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>P</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>Q</i></span> moves in a straight line, it will strike above <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>R</i></span>, as is illustrated by the straight line in the figure. But, on Einstein&#x2019;s assumption,
the light must go through the third slit, as it would do in the system at rest, and
<i>must therefore move in a curved line</i>, like the curved line in the figure, <i>and bend downward in the direction of the gravitational force</i>.

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Tests</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Calculation shows that the deviation of light by the moon or planets would be too
small to detect. But for a ray which had passed near the sun, the deflection comes
out 1.7&#x2033;, which the modern astronomer regards as a large quantity, easy to measure.
Observations to test this can be made only at a total eclipse, when we can photograph
stars near the sun, on a nearly dark sky. A very fine chance came in May, 1919, and
two English expeditions were sent to Brazil and the African coast. These photographs
were measured with extreme care, and they show that the stars actually appear to be
shifted, in almost exactly the way predicted by Einstein&#x2019;s theory.
</p>
<p>Another consequence of &#x201c;general relativity&#x201d; is that Newton&#x2019;s law of gravitation needs
a minute <span class="pagenum" id="pb316">[<a href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>correction. This is so small that there is but a single case in which it can be tested.
On Newton&#x2019;s theory, the line joining the sun to the nearest point upon a planet&#x2019;s
orbit (its perihelion) should remain fixed in direction, (barring certain effects
of the attraction of the other planets, which can be allowed for). On Einstein&#x2019;s theory
it should move slowly forward. It has been known for years that the perihelion of
Mercury was actually moving forward, and all explanations had failed. But Einstein&#x2019;s
theory not only predicts the direction of the motion, but exactly the observed amount.
</p>
<p>Einstein also predicts that the lines of any element in the solar spectrum should
be slightly shifted towards the red, as compared with those produced in our laboratories.
Different observers have investigated this, and so far they disagree. The trouble
is that there are several other influences which may shift the lines, such as pressure
in the sun&#x2019;s atmosphere, motion of currents on the sun&#x2019;s surface, etc., and it is
very hard to disentangle this Gordian knot. At present, the results of these observations
can neither be counted for or against the theory, while those in the other two cases
are decisively favorable.
</p>
<p>The mathematical expression of this general relativity is intricate and difficult.
Mathematicians&#x2014;who are used to conceptions which are unfamiliar, if not incomprehensible,
to most of us&#x2014;find that these expressions may be described (to the trained student)
in terms of space of four dimensions and of the non-Euclidean geometry. We therefore
hear such phrases as &#x201c;time as a sort of fourth dimension,&#x201d; &#x201c;curvature of space&#x201d; and
others. But these are <span class="pagenum" id="pb317">[<a href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>simply attempts&#x2014;not altogether successful&#x2014;to put mathematical relationships into ordinary
language, instead of algebraic equations.
</p>
<p>More important to the general reader are the physical bearings of the new theory,
and these are far easier to understand.
</p>
<p>Various assumptions which we may make about the motion of the universe as a whole,
though they do not influence the observed facts of nature, will lead us to different
ways of interpreting our observations as measurements of space and time.
</p>
<p>Theoretically, one of these assumptions is as good as any other. Hence we no longer
believe in <i>absolute</i> space and time. This is of great interest philosophically. Practically, it is unimportant,
for, unless our choice of an assumption is very wild, our conclusions and measurements
will agree substantially with those which are already familiar.
</p>
<p>Finally, the &#x201c;general&#x201d; relativity shows that gravitation and electro-magnetic phenomena&#x2014;(including
light) do not form two independent sides of nature, as we once supposed, but influence
one another (though slightly) and are parts of one greater whole.

<div class="argument">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">A Simple Explanation of His Postulates and Their Consequences</span></p>
</div>
<p class="byline">BY T. ROYDS, KODAIKANAL OBSERVATORY, INDIA</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Einstein&#x2019;s theory of relativity seeks to represent to us the world as it really is
instead of the world of appearances which may be deceiving us. When I was in town
last week to buy 5 yards of calico I watched the draper very carefully as he measured
the cloth to make sure I was not cheated. Yet experiment can demonstrate, and Einstein&#x2019;s
theory can explain, that the draper&#x2019;s yardstick became longer or shorter according
to the direction in which it was held. The length of the yardstick did not appear
to me to change simply because everything else in the same direction, the store, the
draper, the cloth, the retina of my eye, changed length in the same ratio. Einstein&#x2019;s
theory points out not only this, but every case where appearances are deceptive, and
tries to show us the world of reality.
</p>
<p>Einstein&#x2019;s theory is based on the principle of relativity and before we try to follow
his reasoning we must spend a little time in understanding what he <span class="pagenum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>means by &#x201c;<i>relativity</i>&#x201d; and in grasping how the idea arises. Suppose I wish <i>to define my motion</i> as I travel along in an automobile. I may be moving at the rate of 25 miles an hour
relative to objects fixed on the roadside, but relative to a fellow-passenger I am
not moving at all; relative to the sun I am moving with a speed of 18½ miles per second
in an elliptical orbit, and again relative to the stars I am moving in the direction
of the star <i>Vega</i> at a speed of 12 miles per second. Thus motion can only be defined relative to some
object or point of reference. Now this is not satisfactory to the exact scientist.
Scientists are not content with knowing, for example, that the temperature of boiling
water is +100° C. relative to the temperature of freezing; they have set out to determine
absolute temperatures and have found that water boils at 373° C. above absolute zero.
Why should I not, therefore, determine the absolute motion of the automobile, not
its motion relative to the road, earth, sun or stars, but relative to absolute rest?
</p>
<p>Michelson and Morley set out in their famous experiment to measure the absolute velocity
of their laboratory, which was, of course, fixed on the earth. The experiment consisted
of timing two rays of light over two equal tracks at right angles to each other. When
one track was situated in the direction of the earth&#x2019;s motion they expected to get
the same result as when two scullers of equal prowess are racing in a river, one up
and down the stream and the other <span class="corr" id="xd29e6433" title="Source: acrross">across</span> and back; the winner will be the <span class="pagenum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>sculler rowing across the stream, as working out an example will convince. Even if
the earth had been stationary at the time of one experiment, the earth&#x2019;s motion round
the sun would have been reversed 6 months later and would then have given double the
effect. They found, however, that the two rays of light arrived always an exact dead
heat. All experimenters who have tried since have arrived at the same result and found
it impossible to detect absolute motion.
</p>
<p>The principle of relativity has its foundation in fact on these failures to detect
absolute motion. This principle states that the only motion we can ever know about
is <i>relative</i> motion. If we devise an experiment which ought to reveal absolute motion, nature
will enter into a conspiracy to defeat us. In the Michelson and Morley experiment
the conspiracy was that the track in the direction of the earth&#x2019;s absolute motion
should contract its length by just so much as would allow the ray of light along it
to arrive up to time.
</p>
<p>We see, therefore, that according to the principle of relativity motion must always
remain a relative term, in much the same way as vertical and horizontal, right and
left, are relative terms having only meaning when referred to some observer. We do
not expect to find an absolute vertical and are wise enough not to attempt it; in
seeking to find absolute motion physicists were not so wise and only found themselves
baffled.
</p>
<p>The principle that all motion is relative now requires to be worked out to all its
consequences, as <span class="pagenum" id="pb321">[<a href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>has been done by Einstein, and we have his theory of relativity. Einstein conceives
a world of four dimensions built up of the three dimensions of space, namely up and
down, backwards and forwards, right and left, with time as the fourth dimension. This
is an unusual conception to most of us, so let us simplify it into something which
we can more easily picture but which will still allow us to grasp Einstein&#x2019;s ideas.
Let us confine ourselves for the present to events which happen on this sheet of paper,
<i>i.e.</i>, to space of two dimensions only and take time as our third dimension at right angles
to the plane of the paper. We have thus built up a three dimensional world of space-time
which is every bit as useful to us as a four dimensional representation so long as
we only need study objects moving over the sheet of paper.
</p>
<p>Suppose a fly is crawling over this sheet of paper and let us make a movie record
of it. If we cut up the strip of movie film into the individual pictures and cement
them together one above another in their proper order, we shall build up a solid block
of film which will be a model of our simplified world of space-time and in which there
will be a series of dots representing the motion of the fly over the paper. Just as
I can state the exact position of an object in my room by defining its height above
the floor, its distance from the north wall and its distance from the east wall, so
we can reduce the positions of the dots to figures for use in calculations by measuring
their distances from the three faces intersecting in the lines <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OX</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OY</i></span>, and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OT</i></span>, where <span class="pagenum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span><span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OXAYTBCD</i></span> represents the block of film. The mathematician would call the three lines <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OX</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OY</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OT</i></span> the coordinate axes. Measuring all the dots in this way we shall obtain the motion
of the fly relative to the coordinate axes <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OX</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OY</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OT</i></span>. If we add a block <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OTDYEFGH</i></span> of plain film we can <span class="corr" id="xd29e6487" title="Source: us">use</span> <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>EX</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>EH</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>EF</i></span> as coordinate axes and again obtain the motion of the fly relative to these new axes;
or we
</p>
<div class="figure p322width" id="p322"><img src="images/p322.png" alt="" width="582" height="420"></div><p>
can add block after block so as to keep the axes moving. We can conceive of other
changes of axes. The operator making the movie record might have taken the fly for
the hero of the piece and moved the camera about so as to keep the fly more or less
central in the picture; or he might, by turning the handle first fast and then slow
and by moving the camera, have made the fly appear to be doing stunts. Moving the
camera would change the axes of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span> and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>y</i></span>, and turning the handle at different speeds <span class="pagenum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>would change the axis of time. Again, we might change the axes by pushing the block
out of shape or by distorting it into a state of strain. Whatever change of axes we
make, any dot in the block of film will signify a coincidence of the fly with a certain
point of the paper at a certain time, and the series of dots will, in every case,
be a representation of the motion of the fly. Maybe the representation will be a distorted
one, but who is to say which is the absolutely undistorted representation? The principle
of relativity which we laid down before says that no one set of coordinates will give
the absolute motion of the fly, so that one set is as good as another. The principle
that all motion is relative means, therefore, that no matter how we change our coordinates
of space-time, the laws of motion which we deduce must be the same for all changes.
</p>
<p>To use an analogy, the sculptured head of Shakespeare on my table may appear to have
hollow cheeks when I admit light from the east window only, or to have sunken eyes
with light from the skylight in the roof, but the true shape of the head remains the
same in all lights.
</p>
<p>Hence, if with reference to two consecutive dots in our block of film a mathematical
quantity can be found which will not change no matter how we changes our axes of coordinates,
that quantity must be an expression of the true law of motion of the fly between the
two points of the paper and the two times represented by these two dots. Einstein
has worked out such a quantity remaining constant <span class="pagenum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>for all changes of coordinates of the four dimensional world of space-time.
</p>
<p>In passing we may notice a feature of Einstein&#x2019;s world of space-time which we shall
doubtless find it difficult to conceive, namely, that there is no essential difference
between a time and a distance in space. Since one set of coordinates is as good as
another, we can transform time into space and space into time according as we choose
our axes. For example if we change <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OX</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OT</i></span>, the axes of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span> and time in <a href="#p322">Fig. 2</a>, into <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OX&#x2032;</i></span>, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OT&#x2032;</i></span> by a simple rotation, the new time represented by <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OT&#x2032;</i></span> consists partly of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OA</i></span> in the old time and partly of <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>OB</i></span> in the old <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span> direction. Referring to our block of movie film again, it means that although I might
separate the block into space and time by slicing it into the original pictures, I
can just as readily slice it in any direction I choose and still get individual pictures
representing the motion of the fly but with, of course, new time and space. So whilst
I may be believe that a liner has travelled 3,000 miles in 4 days, an observer on
a star who knows nothing of my particular axes in space-time may say, with equal truth,
that it went 2,000 miles in 7 days. Thus, time and space are not two separate identities
in Einstein&#x2019;s view; there only exists a world of four dimensions which we can split
up into time and space as we choose.
</p>
<p>Let us see now how Einstein explains gravitation. When a body is not acted on by any
forces (except gravitation) the quantity which remains constant for all changes of
coordinates implies that the body will follow that path in the space of an outside
<span class="pagenum" id="pb325">[<a href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>observer which takes the least time. It is an observed fact that one body attracts
another by gravitation; that is, the path of one body is bent from its course by the
presence of another. Now we can bend the path of the fly in our block of film by straining
the block in some way. Suppose, therefore, that I strain the world so as to bend the
path of a body exactly as the gravitation due to some other body bends it; <i>i.e.</i>, by a change of coordinates I have obtained the same effect as that produced by gravitation.
Einstein&#x2019;s theory, therefore, explains gravitation as a distortion of the world of
space-time due to the presence of matter. Suppose first that a body is moving with
no other bodies near; according to Einstein it will take the path in space which requires
the least time, <i>i.e.</i>, a straight line as agrees with our experience. If now the world be strained by the
presence of another body or by a change of coordinates it will still pursue the path
of least time, but this path is now distorted from the straight line, just as in a
similar way the path on a globe requiring the least time to travel follows a great
circle. So, on Einstein&#x2019;s view of gravitation, the earth moves in an elliptical path
around the sun not because a force is acting on it, but because the world of space-time
is so distorted by the presence of the sun that the path of least time through space
is the elliptical path observed. There is, therefore, no need to introduce any idea
of &#x201c;force&#x201d; of gravitation. Einstein&#x2019;s theory explains gravitation only in the sense
that he has explained it away as a force of nature and makes it a property of space-time,
namely, a distortion not <span class="pagenum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>different from an appropriate change of coordinates. He does not, however, explain
how or why a body can distort space-time. It is noteworthy that whilst the law of
gravitation and the law of uniform motion in a straight line when no force is acting
were separate and independent laws under Newton, Einstein finds one explanation for
both under the principle of relativity.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e6559src" href="#xd29e6559">1</a>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Newton&#x2019;s great discovery regarding the motion of the planets consisted in his showing
that these could all be summed up in the following statement: consider any planet
in its relation to all particles in the universe. Write down, for the planet, in the
line joining it to any particle, an acceleration proportional to the mass of the particle
and to the inverse square of its distance from the planet. Then calculate the planet&#x2019;s
resultant acceleration by combining all the accelerations thus obtained.
</p>
<p>We have here purposely avoided the use of the word &#x201c;force,&#x201d; for Newton&#x2019;s law is complete
as a practical statement of fact without it; and this word adds nothing to the law
by way of enhancing its power in actual use. Nevertheless, the fact that the acceleration
is made up as it were of non-interfering contributions from each particle in the line
joining it to the planet strongly suggests to the mind something of the nature of
an elastic pull for which the <span class="pagenum" id="pb328">[<a href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>particle is responsible, and to which the planet&#x2019;s departure from a straight-line
motion is due. The mind likes to think of the elastic; ever since the time of Newton
people have sought to devise some mechanism by which these pulls might be visualized
as responsible for the phenomena in the same way as one pictures an elastic thread
as controlling the motion of a stone which swings around at its end.
</p>
<p>This search has been always without success; and now Einstein has found a rather different
law which fits the facts better than Newton&#x2019;s law. It is of such a type that it does
not lend itself conveniently to expression in terms of force; the mind would gain
nothing by trying to picture such forces as are necessary. It compensates for this,
however, in being capable of visualization in terms of what is ultimately a much simpler
concept.
</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the fundamental ideas involved, suppose for a moment that gravitation
could be annihilated, completely, and suppose I find myself upon this earth in empty
space. You shall be seated at some point in space and shall watch my doings. If I
am in the condition of mind of the people of the reign of King Henry VIII, I shall
believe that the earth does not rotate. If I let go a stone, there being no gravity,
I shall find that it flies away from me with an acceleration. You will know, however,
that the stone really moves in a straight line with constant velocity, and that the
apparent acceleration which I perceive is due to the earth&#x2019;s rotation. If I have argued
that acceleration is due to force, I shall say that the earth repels the stone, and
shall try to find the law governing the <span class="pagenum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span>variation of this force with distance. I may go farther, and try to imagine some reason
for the force, some pushing action transmitted from the earth to the stone through
a surrounding medium; and, you will pity me for all this <span class="corr" id="xd29e6587" title="Source: waste">wasted</span> labor, and particularly for my attempt to find a mechanism to account for the force,
since you know that if I would only accept your measurements all would appear so simple.
</p>
<p>Let us probe this matter a little farther, however, from the stand-point of myself.
I must believe in the reality of the force, since I have to be tied to my chair to
prevent my departure from the earth. I might wonder how this field of force would
affect the propagation of light, chemical action and so forth. For, even though I
had discovered that, by using your measures, I could transform away the apparent effects
of my field of force as far as concerned its power to hurl stones about, I could still
regard this as a mathematical accident, and believe that the force was really there.
Although I might <i>suspect</i> that the same transformation of view-point that would annul the field&#x2019;s effect as
regards the stones would also annul its effect as regards light, etc., I should not
be sure of this, as you would be; and my conscience would hardly allow me to do more
than look upon the assumption of complete <i>equivalence</i> between the apparent field and a change in the system of measurement as a hypothesis.
I should be strongly tempted to make the hypothesis, however.
</p>
<p>Now the question raised by Einstein is whether the force of gravity, which we experience
as a very <span class="pagenum" id="pb330">[<a href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>real thing, may be put upon a footing which is in some way <span class="corr" id="xd29e6600" title="Source: analagous">analogous</span> to that of the obviously fictitious centrifugal force cited above: whether gravitation
may be regarded as a figment of our imagination engendered by the way in which we
measure things. He found that it could be so regarded. He went still farther, and
in his <i>Principle of Equivalence</i>, he postulated that the apparent effects of gravitation <i>in all phenomena</i> could be attributed to the same change in the system of our measurements that would
account for the <i>ordinary</i> phenomena of gravitation. On the basis of this hypothesis he was able to deduce for
subsequent experimental verification, the effects of gravitation on light. He did
not limit himself to such simple changes in our measurements as were sufficient to
serve the purpose of the problem of centrifugal force cited above; but, emboldened
by the assumptions, in the older theory of relativity, of change in standards of length
and time on account of motion, he went even farther than this, and considered the
possibility of change of our measures due to mere proximity to matter.
</p>
<p>His problem amounted to an attempt to find some way in which it was possible to conceive
our scales and clocks as altered, relatively to some more fundamental set, so as to
allow of the planetary motions being uniform and rectilinear with respect to these
fundamental measures, although they appear as they do to us. If we allow our imaginations
perfect freedom as to how the scales may be altered, we shall not balk at assuming
alterations varying in any way we please, Einstein does, however, introduce <span class="pagenum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>restrictions for reasons which we will now discern.
</p>
<p>If we imagine our whole universe, with its observers, planetary orbits, instruments,
and everything else, embedded in a jelly, and then distort the jelly and contents
in any way, the numbers at which our planetary orbits (or rather their telescopic
images) intersect our scales will be unaltered. Moreover, we could vary, in any manner,
the times at which all objects (including the clock hands) occupied their distorted
positions, and the hand of some clock near the point where the planetary image crossed
the scale would record for this occurrence the same dial reading as before. An inhabitant
of this distorted universe would be absolutely unconscious of the change. Now the
<i>General Theory of Relativity</i> which expresses itself in slightly varied forms, amounts to satisfying a certain
philosophical craving of the mind, by asserting that the laws of nature which control
our universe ought to be such that another universe like the above, whose inhabitants
would be unconscious of their change, would also satisfy these laws, not merely from
the standpoint of its own inhabitants, but also from the standpoint of <i>our</i> measurements. In other words, this second universe ought to appear possible to us
as well as to its inhabitants.
</p>
<p>Einstein decides to make his theory conform to this philosophical desire, and this
greatly limits the modifications of clocks and scales which he permits himself for
the purpose of representing gravitation. Further, if we express the alterations of
the measures as functions of proximity to matter, velocity <span class="pagenum" id="pb332">[<a href="#pb332">332</a>]</span>and so forth, our expressions for these alterations will include, as a particular
case, that where matter is absent, although the scales and observer may still remain.
Our alteration of the scales and clocks with velocity must thus revert, for this case,
to that corresponding to the older theory of relativity, in order to avoid predicting
that two observers, in uniform motion relative to each other in empty space, will
measure different values for the velocity of light. In this way, the velocity of light
comes to play a part in expressing the alterations of the measures.
</p>
<p>Even with these restrictions, Einstein was able to do the equivalent of finding an
alteration of scales and clocks in the presence of matter which would account for
our finding that the planetary motions take place very nearly in accordance with Newton&#x2019;s
law. The new law has accounted with surprising accuracy for certain astronomical irregularities
for which Newton&#x2019;s law failed to account, and has predicted at least one previously
unknown phenomenon which was immediately verified.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, it may be of interest to state how the new law describes the motion
of a particle in the vicinity of a body like the earth. The law amounts to stating
that, if we measure a short distance, radially as regards the earth&#x2019;s center, we must
allow for the peculiarity of our units by dividing by
<span lang="zxx" class="displayMath"><img src="formulas/display-f351.1.svg" alt="StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction 2 m upper G Over c squared r EndFraction EndRoot" title="StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction 2 m upper G Over c squared r EndFraction EndRoot" class="f351.1frml"></span>
</p>
<p>where <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>r</i></span> is the distance from the earth&#x2019;s center, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>m</i></span> <span class="pagenum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span>the mass of the earth, <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>c</i></span> the velocity of light, and <span lang="zxx" class="inlineMath"><i>G</i></span> the Newtonian gravitational constant. Tangential measurements require no correction,
but intervals of time as measured by our clocks must be multiplied, for each particular
place, by the above factor. Then, in terms of the corrected measures so obtained,
the particle will be found to describe a straight line with constant velocity although,
in terms of our actual measures, it appears to fall with an acceleration.

<div class="argument">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">The Discussion of This, With Its Difficulties and the Manner in Which Einstein Has
Resolved Them, from the Essay by</span></p>
</div>
<p class="byline">PROF.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;N. DA C. ANDRADE, ORDNANCE COLLEGE, WOOLWICH, ENGLAND</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Having shown that, of several systems all moving with reference to one another with
uniform motion, no one is entitled to any preference over the others, and having deduced
the laws for such systems, Einstein was confronted with a difficulty which had long
been felt. A body rotating, which is a special case of an accelerated body, can be
distinguished from one at rest, without looking outside it, by the existence of the
so-called centrifugal forces.
</p>
<p>This circumstance, which gives certain bodies an absolute or preferential motion,
is unpalatable to the relativist; he would like there to be no difference as regards
forces<a class="noteref" id="xd29e6660src" href="#xd29e6660">1</a> between the case when the earth rotates with reference to outside bodies (the stars)
considered as fixed, and the case when the earth is considered fixed and all outside
bodies rotate around it. This point cannot be investigated by direct <span class="pagenum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>experiment; we can spin a top but we cannot keep a top at rest and spin the world
round it, to see if the forces are same.
</p>
<p>In considering the problem of how to devise laws which should make all <span class="corr" id="xd29e6671" title="Source: rotatons">rotations</span> relative, Einstein conceived the brilliant yet simple idea that gravitation could
be brought into the scheme as an acceleration effect, since both ordinary accelerational
forces and gravitational forces are proportional to the same thing, the mass of a
body. The impossibility of separating the two kinds of effect can be easily seen by
considering the starting of an elevator. When the elevator is quickly accelerated
upwards we feel a downward pull, just as if the gravitational pull had been increased,
and if the acceleration continued to be uniform, bodies tested with a spring balance
would all weigh more in the elevator than they did on firm ground. In a similar way
the whole of the gravitational pull may be considered to be an accelerational effect,
the difficulty being to devise laws of motion which will give the effects that we
find by actual observation.
</p>
<p>But it is obvious that we cannot, by ordinary mechanics, consider the earth as being
accelerated in all directions, which we should have to do, apparently, to account
for the fact that the gravitational pull is always toward the center. [It is obvious
that we cannot explain gravitation by assuming that the earth&#x2019;s surface is continually
moving outward with an accelerated velocity.]<sup><a href="#au227">227</a></sup> So Einstein found that, as long as we treat the problem by Euclid&#x2019;s geometry, we
cannot reach a satisfactory solution. But he found that to the four-dimensional <span class="pagenum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336">336</a>]</span>space made up of the three ordinary dimensions of space, together with the time-dimension
which we have already mentioned in discussing the special theory, may be attributed
a peculiar geometry, the nature of which departs more and more from Euclidean geometry
as we approach a gravitational body, and the net result of which is to make possible
the universal correspondence of gravitation and acceleration.
</p>
<p>This modification of the geometry of space is often spoken of as the &#x201c;curvature of
space,&#x201d; an expression which is puzzling, especially as the space which is &#x201c;curved&#x201d;
is four-dimensional time-space. But we can get an idea of what is meant by considering
figures, triangles say, drawn on the surface, of a sphere. These triangles, although
drawn on a surface, will not have the same properties as triangles drawn on flat paper&#x2014;their
three angles will not together equal right angles. They will be non-Euclidean. This
is only a rough analogy, but we can see that the curvature of the surface causes a
departure from Euclidean geometry for plane figures, and consequently the departure
from Euclidean laws extended to four dimensions may be referred to as caused by &#x201c;curvature
of space.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine a lump of matter affecting the geometry of the space round
it. Once more we must use a rough illustration. Imagine a very hot body, and that,
knowing nothing of its properties, we have to measure up the space round it with metal
measuring-rods. The nearer we are to the body, the longer the rods will become, owing
to the expansion of the metal. When we measure out a <span class="pagenum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>square, one side of which is nearer the body than the opposite side, its angles will
not be right angles. If we knew nothing of the laws of heat we should say that the
body had made the space round it non-Euclidean.
</p>
<p>Einstein found, then, that by taking the properties of space, as given by measurement,
to be modified in the neighborhood of masses of matter, he could devise general laws
according to which gravitational effects would be produced, and there would be no
absolute rotation. All forces will be the same whether a body rotates with everything
outside it fixed, or the body is fixed, and everything rotates round it. <i>All</i> motion is then relative, and the theory is one of &#x201c;general relativity.&#x201d; The velocity
of light is, however, no longer constant, and its path is not a straight line, if
it is passing near gravitating matter. This does not contradict the special theory,
which did not allow for gravitation. Rather, the special theory is a particular case
to which the generalised theory reduces when there is no matter about, just as the
Newtonian dynamics is a special case of the special theory, which we obtain when all
velocities are small compared to that of light.

<p class="first">When Dorothy was carried by the cyclone from her home in Kansas to the land of Oz,
together with her uncle&#x2019;s house and her little dog Toto, she neglected to lower the
trap door over the hole in the floor which formerly led to the cyclone cellar and
Toto stepped through. Dorothy rushed to the opening expecting to see him dashed onto
the rocks below but found him floating just below the floor. She drew him back into
the room and closed the trap.
</p>
<p>The author of the chronicle of Dorothy&#x2019;s adventures explains that the same force which
held up the house held up Toto but this explanation is not necessary. Dorothy was
now floating through space and house and dog were subject to the same forces of gravitation
which gave them identical motions. Dorothy must have pushed the dog down onto the
floor and in doing so must herself have floated to the ceiling whence she might have
pushed herself back to the floor. In fact gravitation was apparently suspended and
Dorothy was in a position to have tried certain experiments which Einstein has never
<span class="pagenum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>tried because he was never in Dorothy&#x2019;s unique position.]<sup><a href="#au188">188</a></sup>

</p>
<p>The Principle of Equivalence, of which Einstein&#x2019;s suspended cage experiment is the
usual illustration, and upon which the generalized theory of relativity is built,
is thus stated by Prof. Eddington: &#x201c;A gravitational field of force is precisely equivalent
to an artificial field of force, so that in any small region it is impossible, by
any conceivable experiment, to distinguish between them. In other words, force is
purely relative.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>This may be otherwise stated by going back to our idea of a four-dimensional world,
the points of which represent the positions and times of events. If we mark in such
a space-time the successive positions of an object we get a line, or curve, which
represents the whole history of the object, inasmuch as it shows us the position of
the object at every time. The reader may imagine that all events happen in one plane,
so that only two perpendicular dimensions are needed to fix positions in space, with
a third perpendicular dimension for time. He may then conceive, if he may not picture,
an analogous process for four-dimensional space-time. These lines, &#x201c;tracks of objects
through space-time,&#x201d; were called by Minkowski &#x201c;world-lines.&#x201d; We may now say that all
the events we observe are the intersections of world-lines. The temperature at noon
was 70°. This means that if I plot the world-line of the top of the mercury column
and the world-line of a certain mark on the glass they intersect in a certain point
of space-time. All that we know are <span class="pagenum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>intersections of these world-lines. Suppose now we have a large number of them drawn
in our four-dimensional world, satisfying all known intersections, and let us suppose
the whole <span class="corr" id="xd29e6717" title="Source: imbedded">embedded</span> in a jelly. We may distort this jelly in any way, changing our coordinates as we
please, but we shall neither destroy nor create intersections of world-lines. It may
be proved that a change from one system of reference, to which observations are referred,
to any other system, moving in any way with respect to the first system, may be pictured
as a distortion of the four-dimensional jelly. The laws of nature, therefore, being
laws that describe intersections, must be expressible in a form independent of the
reference system chosen.
</p>
<p>From these postulates, Einstein was able to show such a formulation possible. His
law may be stated very simply:&#x2014;All bodies move through space-time in the straightest
possible tracks.
</p>
<p>The fact that an easy non-mathematical explanation can not be given, of how this law
is reached, or of just why the straightest track of Mercury through space-time will
give us an ellipse in space after we have split space-time up into space and time,
is no valid objection to the theory. Newton&#x2019;s law that bodies attract with a force
proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
is simple, but no one has ever given an easy non-mathematical proof of how that law
requires the path of Mercury to be an ellipse, with the sun at a focus, instead of
some other curve.]<sup><a href="#au182">182</a></sup>

One of the grave difficulties we have in gaining a satisfactory comprehension of Einstein&#x2019;s
conceptions, is that they do not readily relate themselves to our modes of geometrical
thought. Within limits we may choose our own geometry, but it may be at the cost of
unwieldy complication. If we think with Newton in terms of Euclidean geometry and
consider the earth as revolving around the sun, the motions of our solar system can
be stated in comparatively simple terms. If, on the other hand, we should persist
in stating them, as Ptolemy would have done, from the earth as a relatively stationary
center, our formulas will become complicated beyond ready comprehension. For this
reason it is much simpler in applying the theory of relativity, and in considering
and describing what actually happens in the physical universe, to use geometrical
conceptions to which the actual conditions can be easily related. We find such an
instrument in non-Euclidean geometry, wherein space will appear as though it were
projected from a slightly concave mirror. It is in this sense that some speak of space
as curved. The analogy is so suggestive it tempts one to linger over it. Unless there
were material objects within the range of the mirror, its conformation would be immaterial;
the thought of the space which the mirror, as it were, circumscribes, is dependent
upon the presence of such material objects. The lines of light and of all other movement
will not be quite &#x201c;straight&#x201d; from the view-point of Euclidean geometry. A line drawn
in a universe of such a nature must inevitably return upon itself. Nothing therefore,
can ever pass out of this unlimitedly great <span class="pagenum" id="pb342">[<a href="#pb342">342</a>]</span>but yet finite cosmos. But even now, since our imaginary mirror is only very slightly
concave, it follows that for limited regions like the earth or even the solar system,
our conception of geometry may well be rectilinear and Euclidean. Newton&#x2019;s law of
gravitation will be quite accurate with only a theoretical modification drawn from
the theory of relativity.]<sup><a href="#au82">82</a></sup>

<p>The way in which a curvature of space might appear to us as a force is made plainer
by an example. Suppose that in a certain room a marble dropped anywhere on the floor
always rolled to the center of the room; suppose the same thing happened to a baseball,
a billiard ball, and a tennis ball. These results could be explained in two ways;
we might assume that a mysterious force of attraction existed at the center of the
floor, which affected all kinds of balls alike; or we might assume that the floor
was curved. We naturally prefer the latter explanation. But when we find that in the
neighborhood of a large material body all other bodies move toward it in exactly the
same manner, regardless of their nature or their condition, we are accustomed to postulate
a mysterious attractive force (gravitation); Einstein, on the contrary, adopts the
other alternative, that the space around the body is curved.]<sup><a href="#au223">223</a></sup>

<p>In the ordinary &#x201c;analytical geometry,&#x201d; the position and motion of all the points considered
is referred to a <i>rigid</i> &#x201c;body&#x201d; or &#x201c;frame of reference.&#x201d; This usually consists of an imaginary room of suitable
<span class="pagenum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span>size. The position of any point is then given by three numbers, <i>i.e.</i>, its distances from one side wall and from the back wall and its height above the
floor. These three numbers can only give <i>one</i> point, every <i>other</i> point having at least one number different. In four-dimensional geometry a fourth
wall may be vaguely imagined as perpendicular to all three walls, and a fourth number
added, giving the distance of the &#x201c;point&#x201d; from this wall also. Since &#x201c;rigid&#x201d; bodies
do not exist in gravitational fields the &#x201c;frame of reference&#x201d; must be &#x201c;non-rigid.&#x201d;
The frame of reference in the Gaussian system need not be rigid, it can be of any
shape and moving in any manner, in fact a kind of jelly. A &#x201c;point&#x201d; or &#x201c;event&#x201d; in the
four dimensioned world is still given by four numbers but these numbers do not represent
distances from anywhere; all that is necessary is that no two events shall have exactly
the same four numbers to represent them, and that two events which are very close
together shall be represented by numbers which differ only slightly from one another.
This system assumes so little that it will be seen to be very wide in its scope; although
to the ordinary mind, what is gained in scope seems more than that lost in concreteness.
This does not concern the mathematician, however, and by using this system he gains
his object, proving that the general laws of nature remain the same when expressed
in <i>any</i> Gaussian <span class="corr" id="xd29e6764" title="Source: co-ordinate">coordinate</span> system whatever.]<sup><a href="#au220">220</a></sup>

of <span class="corr" id="xd29e6775" title="Source: co-ordinate">coordinate</span> axes which is exactly equivalent to any force, and in particular <span class="pagenum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>one which is equivalent to the force of gravitation. That is by concentrating our
attention on the transformation which is a purely mathematical operation we can afford
to neglect the force completely. To get a better idea of this principle of equivalence
as it is called, let us consider a relatively simple example (which actually has nothing
to do with <span class="corr" id="xd29e6780" title="Source: gravitaton">gravitation</span>, but which will serve to make our notions clearer.) A person on the earth unconsciously
refers all his experiences, <i>i.e.</i>, the motions of the objects around him to a set of axes fixed in the earth on which
he stands. However, we know that the earth is rotating about its axis, and his axes
of reference are also rotating with respect to the space about him. From the point
of view of general relativity it is exactly because we do refer motions on the surface
of the earth to axes rotating with the earth that we experience the so-called centrifugal
force of the earth&#x2019;s rotation, with which everyone is familiar. If we could find it
<i>convenient</i> to transform from moving axes to fixed axes, the force would vanish, since it is
exactly equivalent to the transformation from one set of axes to the other. However,
we find it unnatural to refer daily experiences to axes that are not placed where
we happen to be, and so we prefer to take the force and rotating axes instead of no
force and fixed axes.]<sup><a href="#au272">272</a></sup>

<p>We seem to have a direct experience of force in our muscular sensations. By pushing
or pulling we can set bodies in motion. It is natural to assume, that something similar
occurs, when Nature set bodies in motion. But is this not a relic of animism? <span class="pagenum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>The savage and the ancients peopled all the woods and skies with Gods and demons,
who carries on the activities of nature by their own bodily efforts. Today we have
dispossessed the demons, but the <i>ghost of a muscular pull</i> still holds the planets in place.]<sup><a href="#au141">141</a></sup>

<p>The general theory is an extension of the special theory which enables the law of
gravitation to be deduced. Not in Newton&#x2019;s form, it is true, but in a better form,
that is, one that accounts for two important facts otherwise not explained. But it
is a far more general theory that indicated above. It is a complete study of the relations
between laws expressed by means of any four coordinates (of which three space and
one time is a special case), and the same laws expressed in the four <span class="corr" id="xd29e6808" title="Source: co-ordinates">coordinates</span> of a system having any motion whatever with respect to the first system. By restricting
this general study in accordance with certain postulates about the nature of the universe
we <span class="corr" id="xd29e6811" title="Source: line">live</span> in, we arrive at a number of conclusions which fit more closely with observed facts
that the conclusions drawn from Newton&#x2019;s theory.]<sup><a href="#au221">221</a></sup>
